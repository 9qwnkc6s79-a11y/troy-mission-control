Brief</h1>
<h2 id="texas-lca-data-fy2024-q4">Texas LCA Data — FY2024 Q4</h2>
<p><strong>Prepared:</strong> January 26, 2026<br />
<strong>Data Source:</strong> Department of Labor OFLC Disclosure
Data<br />
<strong>Scope:</strong> Texas H-1B Labor Condition Applications with
residential worksite addresses</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Analysis of publicly available DOL Labor Condition Application (LCA)
data reveals a pattern of suspected H-1B visa fraud involving
<strong>285 filings listing residential addresses as worksites</strong>
in Texas during FY2024 Q4 alone. Of these, <strong>90 filings explicitly
list apartment units</strong> as the primary worksite — a strong
indicator of worker “benching” and wage theft schemes.</p>
<p><strong>Top Offenders by Filing Volume:</strong> | Company |
Residential Filings | |———|———————| | Cognizant Technology Solutions |
79 | | Eficens Systems Inc | 16 | | Wipro Limited | 10 | | RJ Systems
Inc | 6 | | Capgemini America Inc | 5 |</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="fraud-patterns-identified">Fraud Patterns Identified</h2>
<h3 id="systematic-worker-benching">1. Systematic Worker Benching</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> H-1B regulations require employers to
pay the LCA-stated wage and provide actual work. “Benching” occurs when
companies bring workers to the U.S. but have no immediate project
placement, leaving workers at home without pay or at reduced wages.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence in data:</strong> - 79 Cognizant filings list
individual apartment addresses (e.g., “8401 Memorial Lane, Apartment
7171, Plano”) - Workers listed as “Manager” or “Senior Manager” at
apartment addresses - Same apartment complexes appear repeatedly with
different unit numbers</p>
<p><strong>Violation:</strong> 20 CFR 655.731 — Employer must pay
required wage for nonproductive time if benching is employer’s fault</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="body-shop-staffing-mill-operations">2. Body Shop / Staffing Mill
Operations</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Small IT staffing companies file
speculative LCAs, bring workers on H-1B visas, then attempt to find
client placements. Workers wait at residential addresses (often their
own apartments) until placed.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence in data:</strong> - Small companies (EFICENS
SYSTEMS, SAGE IT, RJ Systems) filing multiple LCAs at apartment
addresses - No apparent commercial office presence - Pattern of
residential addresses across multiple ZIP codes suggests distributed
“workforce” with no central workplace</p>
<p><strong>Companies of concern:</strong> - EFICENS SYSTEMS INC — 16
filings at residential addresses - SAGE IT INC — 3 filings at apartments
- RJ Systems Inc — 6 filings at residential addresses</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="shell-company-networks">3. Shell Company Networks</h3>
<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Related entities operating under
different company names at the same residential address, potentially to
circumvent H-1B caps, distribute liability, or obscure ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence in data:</strong> - <strong>2309 Gracy Farms Ln,
Austin 78758</strong> — Two different companies (SDH Systems LLC and
Persistent Systems Limited) list this address as worksite with combined
19+ LCAs and 27+ workers - Multiple small IT companies share addresses
in Irving/Plano apartment corridors - Pattern suggests coordinated
operations rather than coincidental co-location</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="wage-theft-mechanism">4. Wage Theft Mechanism</h3>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> 1. Company files LCA stating wage of
$80,000-$150,000/year 2. Worker brought to U.S. on H-1B tied to that
employer 3. Worker placed at apartment address (no actual work
assignment) 4. Company pays fraction of stated wage — or nothing during
“bench” periods 5. Worker cannot report violations due to deportation
fear (visa status controlled by employer) 6. Company profits from wage
differential</p>
<p><strong>Indicators in data:</strong> - High wages listed ($100K+) for
workers at apartment addresses - “Manager” and “Senior Manager” titles
at residential worksites (title inflation to justify higher LCA wages) -
IT consulting roles that typically require on-site client presence
listed at apartments</p>
