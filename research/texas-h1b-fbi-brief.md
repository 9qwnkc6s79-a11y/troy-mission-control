## VII. ASSESSMENT

1. **Labor Market Impact:** H-1B workers represent a significant portion of Texas's technology workforce, particularly in software development and systems architecture roles.

2. **Geographic Concentration:** The DFW metroplex's dominance (48% share) creates workforce concentration risk and competitive pressure in specific submarkets (Plano, Irving, Frisco).

3. **Staffing Firm Prevalence:** Indian IT staffing companies continue to dominate sponsorship, with workers frequently placed at Fortune 500 client sites rather than the sponsoring firm's own operations.

4. **Wage Observations:** Median wage of $106,197 exceeds Texas median household income by approximately 2x, indicating H-1B positions are predominantly in high-skill, high-compensation roles.

5. **Growth Trajectory:** Texas H-1B activity has grown 17% from FY2022 to FY2024, outpacing national averages, driven by corporate relocations and technology sector expansion.
