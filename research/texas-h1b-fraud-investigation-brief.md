# INVESTIGATIVE BRIEF
## H-1B Visa Fraud — Dallas-Fort Worth / Texas
### Classification: LAW ENFORCEMENT SENSITIVE

---

**DATE:** January 26, 2026  
**PREPARED FOR:** Federal Bureau of Investigation  
**SUBJECT:** H-1B Visa Program Fraud Indicators and Investigation Guide — Texas/DFW Focus  
**DISTRIBUTION:** Authorized Law Enforcement Personnel Only

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The H-1B visa program is vulnerable to systemic fraud, particularly involving **IT staffing companies** that dominate sponsorship in Texas. This brief provides investigators with an overview of common fraud schemes, red flag indicators, and Texas-specific data to support investigations into visa fraud, wire fraud, and related offenses.

**Key Vulnerability:** Indian IT staffing firms ("body shops") account for approximately **15% of all Texas H-1B certifications**, operating a high-volume, low-margin business model with documented patterns of non-compliance and fraud.

---

## II. PROGRAM OVERVIEW — FRAUD VULNERABILITIES

### A. How the H-1B System Works

1. **Employer files Labor Condition Application (LCA)** with Department of Labor
   - Certifies wage ≥ prevailing wage
   - Certifies working conditions
   - Specifies job location(s)
   
2. **Employer files I-129 Petition** with USCIS
   - Demonstrates "specialty occupation"
   - Shows employer-employee relationship
   - Provides evidence of work
   
3. **Worker enters U.S.** tied to specific employer
   - Cannot work for other employers
   - Must be paid even if "benched" (no active project)
   - Employer must notify USCIS if employment ends

### B. Systemic Vulnerabilities

| Stage | Vulnerability | Fraud Type |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| LCA Filing | Self-attestation, minimal verification | Wage fraud, location fraud |
| I-129 Petition | Speculative filings allowed | Shell company fraud |
| Employment | Third-party placements | Benching, wage theft |
| Oversight | Limited site visits | Fictitious worksites |

---

## III. COMMON FRAUD SCHEMES

### SCHEME 1: Benching / Wage Theft
**Prevalence: HIGH**

**Description:** Employer does not pay H-1B worker full salary when worker is not placed on a billable project ("on the bench").

**Legal Requirement:** Employers MUST pay the certified LCA wage regardless of whether worker is generating revenue.

**Red Flags:**
- Worker bank records show irregular/missing payments
- Worker placed in multiple short-term assignments
- Large gap between LCA filing date and actual start of work
- Company has high ratio of LCAs filed to actual employees

**Evidence Sources:**
- Worker pay stubs, bank records
- LCA wage rate vs. actual W-2
- Worker testimony
- Company payroll records

---

### SCHEME 2: Shell Companies / Visa Mills
**Prevalence: MODERATE-HIGH in DFW**

**Description:** Entity exists primarily to sponsor H-1B visas without legitimate business operations. May collect fees from workers, file speculative petitions, or facilitate placement at third parties while taking a cut.

**Indicators:**
- Company has no visible business presence (empty office, virtual address)
- High volume of H-1B filings relative to company size
- Company revenue primarily from "placement fees" or worker wages
- Workers immediately placed at third-party client sites
- Company has few/no non-H-1B employees
- Registered agent services, no physical operations

**DFW Hot Spots:**
- Small offices in Plano, Irving, Richardson business parks
- Virtual office addresses
- Residential addresses listed as business locations

---

### SCHEME 3: LCA Location Fraud
**Prevalence: HIGH**

**Description:** Employer certifies one work location on LCA but places worker at different location(s) without filing amended LCA or paying appropriate prevailing wage.

**How It Works:**
- File LCA for low-cost area (e.g., rural Texas)
- Place worker in high-cost area (e.g., San Francisco client site)
- Pay worker the lower certified wage
- Pocket the difference

**Red Flags:**
- Worker's actual work location differs from LCA
- Company has LCAs for locations with no known clients
- Multiple LCAs list same obscure location
- Worker testimony contradicts filed location

---

### SCHEME 4: Third-Party Placement Fraud
**Prevalence: VERY HIGH (Industry-Wide)**

**Description:** Staffing company files H-1B for worker but has no direct work—worker is immediately placed at third-party client. May involve:
- Misrepresenting employer-employee relationship
- Failing to maintain required control over worker
- End client actually directs worker's duties

**Legal Issue:** H-1B requires genuine employer-employee relationship. If end client controls worker, the staffing company may not qualify as the employer.

**High-Risk Employers (by volume):**
| Company | 3-Yr TX LCAs | Business Model |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Cognizant | 1,379 | IT Staffing/Consulting |
| Infosys | 1,212 | IT Staffing/Consulting |
| TCS | 1,015 | IT Staffing/Consulting |
| HCL | 613 | IT Staffing/Consulting |
| Wipro | 439 | IT Staffing/Consulting |
| Compunnel | 345 | IT Staffing |
| Tech Mahindra | 225 | IT Staffing/Consulting |

---

### SCHEME 5: Fraudulent Credentials
**Prevalence: MODERATE**

**Description:** Worker or employer misrepresents worker's qualifications, education, or experience to meet "specialty occupation" requirements.

**Common Frauds:**
- Fake degrees from Indian universities
- Falsified resumes/experience
- Diploma mills (especially for non-CS workers seeking tech jobs)
- Fraudulent credential evaluation services

**Red Flags:**
- University not recognized by UGC (India) or equivalent
- Credential evaluator not NACES/AICE member
- Work experience claims cannot be verified
- LinkedIn profile inconsistent with petition claims

---

### SCHEME 6: Fee Charging / Debt Bondage
**Prevalence: MODERATE**

**Description:** Employer charges worker fees for visa sponsorship, training, or placement—which is **illegal**. May also impose excessive penalty clauses trapping workers.

**Illegal Practices:**
- Charging H-1B filing fees to worker (employer's legal obligation)
- Requiring worker to sign promissory notes
- "Training bonds" with inflated penalties
- Withholding passport or immigration documents

**Evidence:**
- Employment contracts with fee provisions
- Worker testimony about payments
- Wire transfers from worker to employer (pre-employment)
- Promissory notes, penalty clauses

### B. Investigation Steps

1. **Identify Target Employer**
   - High LCA volume relative to size
   - Complaints from workers
   - Tips from competitors

2. **Pull LCA Filings**
   - Compare certified wages to actual W-2s
   - Map worksite locations
   - Identify patterns

3. **Interview Workers**
   - Actual work location
   - Actual wages received
   - Fees charged
   - Working conditions

4. **Site Visits**
   - Verify business presence
   - Confirm workers at stated location
   - Observe operations

5. **Financial Records**

## X. SUMMARY — KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **IT staffing companies** are the highest-risk category for H-1B fraud in DFW, particularly those with high LCA volumes and third-party placement models.

2. **Benching and wage theft** are endemic—compare LCA certified wages to actual W-2 earnings.

3. **Location fraud** is common—verify workers are actually at the certified worksite.

4. **Shell companies** operate in DFW business parks, filing speculative petitions without real work.

5. **Worker cooperation** is essential but challenging due to immigration status concerns—emphasize victim status and coordinate with USCIS.

6. **Financial records** are key—subpoena bank records to prove actual wages vs. certified amounts.
