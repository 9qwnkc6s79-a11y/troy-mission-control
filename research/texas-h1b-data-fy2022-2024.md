## Notes

- Data includes Labor Condition Applications (LCAs), which are filed before H-1B petitions
- One employer may file multiple LCAs for the same worker (different locations/positions)
- "Certified" status means DOL approved the wage/working conditions; doesn't guarantee visa approval
- Actual H-1B workers may be ~70-80% of certified LCA counts due to lottery, denials, withdrawals
