# TapMango Sales Optimization Report
**Boundaries Coffee | February 2026**

---

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED (Feb 5, 2026 @ 11:04 PM)

### 1. Win-Back MISSU Voucher - FIXED
**Before:** "Free Drip Coffee with a $5+ purchase" (0.92% redemption)
**After:** "FREE Small Specialty Drink - We Miss You!" (no purchase required)

**Changes made:**
- Updated description to be more compelling
- **Removed the $5 minimum purchase requirement** from Mobile Ordering discount
- This was the main barrier - customers had to spend $5 to get a free $2 drip. Now it's truly free.

### 2. Streak Campaign - DIAGNOSED (Needs TapMango Support)
**Issue:** Campaign is LIVE but 0 vouchers created because no customers are being added to the Streak Group.
**Root cause:** The automation that populates the Streak Group (based on consecutive visits) isn't configured or isn't working.
**Recommended action:** Contact TapMango support to configure Streak Group auto-population rules.

## Executive Summary

After analyzing your TapMango app data, I've identified several opportunities to increase sales. Your **Revenue Boost is down 26% month-over-month** ($5,561 vs $7,503). The biggest issues are:

1. **Win-back campaigns have terrible redemption rates** (0.92% - 8.59%)
2. **MMS overage** costing extra money
3. **Streak reward broken** (0% redemption)
4. **Mobile ordering underutilized** (0 curbside, 0 delivery)
5. **Email massively underused** (7% of capacity)

## What's Working Well ✅

### 1. Welcome Offers (New Customer Conversion)
Your "Free Small Drink + 20 Points" welcome voucher is crushing it:
- **66.83% redemption rate**
- **$23,311 revenue boost**
- This is excellent - keep it

### 2. Points Rewards
The 1,000-point "Free Small Specialty Drink" reward drives the most value:
- **$25,052 revenue boost** (highest of all rewards)
- Sweet spot between attainability and value

### 3. Review Boost

- 709 sent to Google
- 4.9 avg rating
- This is solid

## What's Broken 🚨

### 1. Win-Back (MISSU) Vouchers - CRITICAL
These campaigns fire at 14, 30, and 45 days after last visit, but redemption is terrible:

| Voucher | Redemption Rate | Created | Redeemed |
|---------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| Free Drip with $5+ purchase | **0.92%** | 17,954 | 166 |
| Free Baked Good with Specialty | **4.12%** | 9,736 | 401 |
| $2 off | **8.59%** | 7,093 | 609 |

**Problem:** These offers aren't compelling enough. A free drip coffee requiring a $5 purchase isn't exciting - it's basically "buy something and get a $2 drip free."

**Impact:** 17,954 win-back vouchers sent but only 166 redeemed = massive wasted opportunity.

### 2. Streak Reward - COMPLETELY BROKEN
- $5 Off Streak voucher: **0% redemption** (0 created, 0 redeemed)
- Something is wrong with the trigger or the reward isn't reaching anyone

### 3. Birthday Voucher - Underperforming
- 18.96% redemption rate
- Could be much higher with the right offer

---

## Recommendations

### PRIORITY 1: Fix Win-Back Offers (HIGH IMPACT)

Replace current MISSU vouchers with more compelling offers:

**Current (Weak):**
- Free Drip Coffee with $5+ purchase → 0.92% redemption

**Suggested (Strong):**
- **14 days:** "We miss you! Here's a FREE small specialty drink - no purchase required"
- **30 days:** "Come back for 50% off any drink this week only"
- **45 days:** "Final call: FREE drink + 100 bonus points waiting for you"

The key is making the first touchpoint **zero friction** - give something away to get them back in the door.

### PRIORITY 2: Add a "Quick Win" Reward (NEW)

Current lowest reward is 500 points ($50 spend). Add:
- **250 points = Free flavor add-in or size upgrade**
- Creates faster gratification loop
- Encourages more frequent visits

### PRIORITY 3: Fix the Streak Campaign

Check why Streak $5 Off has 0% redemption:
- Is the trigger configured correctly?
- Is it being assigned to customers?
- Consider a more exciting streak reward

### PRIORITY 4: Double Points Promotions

Run periodic double/triple points events:
- **Slow day booster:** "Double Points Tuesdays" (or your slowest day)
- **Weather-based:** "It's cold! Triple points on hot drinks today"
- **App push:** Use push notifications (free) to announce

### PRIORITY 5: Enable Curbside Ordering

You have 329 orders/month but 0 curbside. Enable it to:
- Capture busy parents who can't come inside
- Increase convenience = more orders
- Differentiate from competitors

### PRIORITY 6: Weekly Email Specials

You're using 7% of your email capacity (1,482 of 20,000).

**Suggestion:** Weekly "What's New" email:
- New seasonal drinks
- Weekly special
- Reward reminder ("You're X points from a free drink!")
- Costs almost nothing, high ROI

### PRIORITY 7: Flash Sales via Instant Deals

Set up Stripe or Square payment processor to enable Instant Deals:
- "Buy 5 drinks for $20" (prepaid punch card)
- "Monthly Coffee Pass - $50 for unlimited drip"
- Creates upfront revenue and guarantees return visits

### PRIORITY 8: Segment-Specific Campaigns

You have great customer groups already set up. Use them:

| Group | Campaign Idea |
|-------|---------------|
| Big Spenders Recently | VIP appreciation - bonus points or exclusive reward |
| Inactive Customers | Stronger win-back offer (see Priority 1) |
| Teachers | "Teacher Appreciation" special around key dates |
| First Responders | Dedicated appreciation day with bonus points |
| Veterans | Similar to above |
| 5 Stars Feedback | Ask for Google review (high likelihood of 5-star) |
| Dissatisfied (0-6) | Personal outreach to understand issues |

### PRIORITY 9: Birthday Campaign Optimization

Current: 18.96% redemption for free latte

Improve by:
- Sending reminder 7 days before birthday
- Sending reminder on birthday
- Extending validity (birthday week vs day)
- Make it shareable ("bring a friend, they get 50% off")

### PRIORITY 10: Reduce MMS Spend

You're 1,124 messages over your MMS limit. For most automated campaigns:
- Switch to SMS (text only) - cheaper
- Use Push notifications first (free)
- Reserve MMS for high-impact visual promotions

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Current | 30-Day Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Revenue Boost | $5,561 | $7,500+ |
| Win-back Redemption Rate | 0.92-8.59% | 15%+ |
| Mobile Orders/Day | ~11 | 15+ |
| Email Utilization | 7% | 25%+ |
| MMS Overage | 1,124 | 0 |

---

## Summary

Your app has great bones - strong welcome conversion (66.83%), good rewards structure, and a solid customer base. The main issue is **win-back campaigns aren't bringing people back**.

Fix the MISSU vouchers with compelling, friction-free offers and you'll recover that 26% revenue drop.
