## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Context windows truncate — ALWAYS save working state to files
- Don't rely on thread memory for important info
- Browser automation is slow — prefer APIs
- Daniel wants proactive work, not just reactive responses
- He's busy — handle what you can, escalate what you can't
- **EMAIL PROTOCOL**: Draft only, don't send — let Daniel review until trust is built (added 2026-01-25)
- **TRADEMARK CHECK**: Always run USPTO search before committing to a brand name. "Luum" was blocked by existing Class 005 filing (2026-01-31)
- **Daniel's business philosophy**: Time > money. He'd rather spend $20K on something Troy builds autonomously than spend his own time. ROI = time saved, not just capital return.
- **Track 2 approach**: Launch multiple small businesses in parallel via AI, Daniel approves key decisions only. Quick wins fund bigger plays.
- **Brand names**: Daniel wants to approve all brand names. Pull inspiration from hot retail health brands (Ritual, Seed, AG1, LMNT, Hims). Always verify USPTO + domain availability before presenting.

## 🍽️ Toast POS — SOPs

### Setting Up Secret Menu Items (New Menu → Secret Cold Lattes)
**Location:** Prosper (Restaurant ID: 260183)
**Full SOP in:** `memory/2026-01-30.md`

**Quick Steps:**
1. Create item in Secret Cold Lattes menu group (pricing inherited: $5.93/16oz, $6.45/20oz)
2. If new modifiers needed → Navigate to the shared modifier group → Add → Save
   - ⚠️ New modifiers in shared groups affect ALL items using that group
3. On the item page, scroll to defaults table → Enable "Override?" for each group needing defaults → Check specific modifier checkboxes → Save

**JavaScript technique:** Defaults table is `table[5]` on item page. Override is cells[1], defaults cells[2]. Checkboxes disabled until Override checked. Use `.click()` on inputs.

**Key modifier group indices (table row numbers):**
1=Alt Milk, 2=Other Coffee, 3=Shots, 4=Other, 5=Healthy Adds, 6=Recipe SC, 7=Recipe Flavors, 8=Recipe Toppings

**Detailed index maps for each modifier group saved in** `memory/2026-01-30.md`
