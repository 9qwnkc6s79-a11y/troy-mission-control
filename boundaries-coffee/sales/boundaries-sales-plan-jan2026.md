## January 2026 Strategic Review & Action Plan

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Diagnosis:** Marketing has completely stopped. Zero content posted last week. No ads running since November 5, 2025. This is the #1 problem killing your sales growth.

**The Good News:** Your operations are solid. Weekday sales are UP 10-44%. Labor is controlled. Your signature drinks sell. You have the foundation—you just need to turn the marketing machine back on.

**The Fix:** Restart content engine immediately, launch new menu items monthly, run consistent paid ads, and implement the "Idea to Menu" workflow below.

# PART 1: CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

## Sales Performance (Little Elm - Week of Jan 19-25)

| Metric | This Week | vs Prior Week | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|

| Guest Count | 598 | ↓ 31.7% | Weather impact |

|--------|-------|-------------|
| Last 60 days | $0.00 | 0 |
| Oct 6 - Nov 5, 2025 | $449.86 | 1 campaign |

**Your last ad campaign got 152,200 views and reached 43,152 people for $450.** That's $0.003 per view—excellent ROI. Then you stopped.

---

# PART 2: WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT ✅

1. **Operations are tight** - Labor at 30%, well-controlled
2. **Signature drink works** - TX Delight sells consistently hot and iced
3. **Food drives traffic** - Breakfast Taco is #1 item
4. **Seasonal items perform** - Crème Brûlée, Blueberry Stack doing well
5. **Weekday sales growing** - You have momentum on execution

---

# PART 3: WHAT YOU'RE DOING WRONG ❌

### 1. Content Drought (CRITICAL)
- Zero posts last week
- Interactions down 61%
- No visibility = no new customers

### 2. Ads Stopped (CRITICAL)

### 3. No New Menu Items
- Winter menu launched and... crickets
- No "new item" excitement to drive visits
- Missing the monthly launch rhythm

### 4. No Consistent Posting Schedule
- Sporadic content doesn't build audience
- Algorithm punishes inconsistency
- Followers forget you exist

# CONCLUSION

**The diagnosis is simple:** You stopped marketing. The fix is equally simple: Start again.

Your operations are solid. Your products sell. Your last ad campaign crushed it. You just need to show up consistently.

**Priority #1:** Content. Get visible again.
**Priority #2:** New menu excitement. Give people a reason to visit.
**Priority #3:** Paid ads. Amplify what's working.

The new drink recipes are ready. The schedule is set. The only thing missing is execution.

Let's go.
