## Competitor Watch: What 7 Brew is Doing

You mentioned wanting to model their "infinite menu" approach. Key insight: their seasonal menus typically include 4-6 featured drinks but EVERYTHING is customizable.

Recommendation: Launch 5-6 hero drinks for spring but make all flavor components available as add-ons so customers can create their own combinations.

## Quick Wins (Low-Hanging Fruit)

1. **Rename "Iced Blueberry Stack"** for spring → "Blueberry Cheesecake" or similar (capitalize on its growth)
2. **Add "local honey" modifier** to any drink (premium upsell)
3. **Pistachio syrup** alone enables multiple new drinks
4. **Pink + green layered drinks** = free social media content
