# Boundaries Coffee - Social Media Plan

*Created: 2026-01-25*

---

## Current State

- **Platforms:** Instagram, Facebook (one account for both locations)
- **Scheduling tools:** None currently
- **Brand guide:** Pending from Daniel
- **Posting:** Manual, inconsistent

---

## Recommended Scheduling Tool: **Later**

After researching options, I recommend **Later** for these reasons:

| Tool | Pros | Cons | Price |
|------|------|------|-------|
| **Later** ✓ | Visual calendar, approval workflow, IG-focused, Linkin.bio, easy UX | Limited analytics on free tier | Free (1 profile) / $25/mo (Growth) |
| Buffer | Simple, clean, multi-platform | Less visual planning | Free (3 channels) / $6/mo per channel |
| Planoly | Great for visual brands | IG-only focus | $16/mo+ |
| Meta Business Suite | Free, native to FB/IG | Clunky UX, no approval flow | Free |

**Why Later:**
1. Visual grid preview — see how posts look before publishing
2. Approval workflow — you review before anything goes live
3. Strong Instagram features (stories, reels scheduling)
4. Linkin.bio for driving traffic
5. Reasonable price if we upgrade

**Alternative:** If budget is tight, we can start with Meta Business Suite (free) and upgrade later.

## Proposed Workflow

```
Troy drafts post → Schedules in Later (Draft) → Daniel reviews/approves → Post goes live
```

1. I create content based on brand guide + calendar
2. Schedule as drafts in Later
3. You get notification to review (or check weekly)
4. Approve or request changes
5. Approved posts publish automatically

## Content Pillars (Draft)

Based on typical coffee shop social, here's a starting framework:

1. **Product Shots** (40%) — Drinks, food, seasonal specials
2. **Behind the Scenes** (20%) — Staff, process, roasting, prep
3. **Community** (20%) — Customers, local events, shoutouts
4. **Promos & Announcements** (15%) — New items, hours, specials
5. **Brand Personality** (5%) — Humor, values, culture

*Will refine once I see the brand guide.*

## Next Steps

1. **Daniel:** Send brand guide when you have a moment
2. **Daniel:** Confirm Later (or pick alternative)
3. **Troy:** Set up Later account (or guide you through it)
4. **Troy:** Audit existing Instagram content
5. **Troy:** Draft first week of posts for review

---

## Access Needed

To post/manage, I'll eventually need:
- [ ] Later account access (once set up)
- [ ] Instagram credentials OR connected via Later
- [ ] Facebook Page access (if separate from IG)

We can figure out the safest way to handle credentials when we get there.

## Questions for Daniel

1. How often do you want to post? (Rec: 4-5x/week Instagram, 3x/week Facebook)
2. Any topics that are off-limits or sensitive?
3. Do you have a library of photos, or do we need to create content?
4. Any competitors or accounts you admire that I should study?
