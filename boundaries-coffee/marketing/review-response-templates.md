## Response Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Respond within 24-48 hours
✅ Use the reviewer's name
✅ Thank them for feedback (even negative)
✅ Keep it brief (1-3 sentences for positive, 2-4 for negative)
✅ Include natural keywords ("drive-thru coffee in Little Elm")
✅ Take serious issues offline (provide contact info)
✅ Sign with a name for personal touch

### DON'T:
❌ Copy-paste identical responses
❌ Be defensive or argumentative
❌ Blame the customer
❌ Ignore negative reviews
❌ Over-promise ("free coffee for life!")
❌ Share private details about incidents

---

## Keywords to Naturally Include

When possible, weave these into responses:
- "drive-thru coffee"
- "Little Elm" or "Prosper"
- "craft coffee"
- "specialty drinks"
- Menu items mentioned in review

Example:
> "Thanks for trying our **nitro cold brew** at our **Little Elm drive-thru**! See you next time!"

---

## Handling Fake/Spam Reviews

If you suspect a review is fake:
1. **Don't respond publicly** (it looks like engagement)
2. **Flag the review** via GBP → Reviews → Flag as inappropriate
3. **Document** why you believe it's fake
4. If it's clearly someone who was never a customer, you can respond:
   > "We don't have a record of this visit. If you did visit us, please reach out so we can resolve this."

## Review Request Strategy

### When to Ask:
- Right after a positive interaction at the window
- In email receipts (if using)
- On social media after positive comments

### How to Ask:
**Verbal (at window):**
> "Thanks so much! If you have a minute, we'd really appreciate a Google review. It helps us a ton!"

**Card/Sticker:**
Create a small card or sticker with QR code linking to Google review page.

### Review Link Shortcut:
Create short links like:
- boundariescoffee.com/review → redirects to Google review page
- Or use bit.ly for tracking
