## ⚠️ Key Concerns

1. **Net follower loss on Instagram (-24):** 69 unfollows vs 45 new follows. This could indicate content isn't retaining audience interest, or that some followers from the influencer boost are churning.

2. **Content gap Jan 18–24:** Zero posts and zero stories across both platforms for an entire week. This directly caused the reach crash to just 66 people that week.

3. **Low Facebook engagement:** Only 11 content interactions across the entire month despite 2.8K views. Facebook content strategy needs attention.

4. **Heavy reliance on Stories:** Most content this week was Stories, which expire in 24 hours and don't contribute to long-term discoverability.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Post at least 1 feed post on Facebook** — Meta's weekly plan shows 0/1 completed. Even a quick cross-post helps maintain the algorithm.
2. **Engage the DFW influencer** — Reply to/comment on their Reel, reshare it to Stories, and consider building an ongoing relationship. That single UGC Reel drove the biggest reach spike of the month.
3. **Share a Reel this week** — Meta explicitly recommends "Posting 1-3 reels a week to keep your audience engaged and grow reach."

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
4. **Establish a minimum posting cadence:** At least 3 feed posts + daily Stories per week. The week with zero content was devastating to reach.
5. **Lean into what works:** The "We'll be open tomorrow" post had the best engagement rate (3.7%). Operational/hours content resonates — customers want to know when you're open, especially with weather closures.
6. **Create content targeting the 25–34 women demographic** — They're 28.8% of your audience. Think: latte art, cozy vibes, "mom fuel" energy, patio content.

### Strategic (Monthly)
7. **Influencer outreach program:** The UGC Reel proves this works. Identify 3–5 local DFW food/lifestyle creators and offer complimentary visits in exchange for content.
8. **Address the unfollow rate:** 69 unfollows in a month is elevated. Audit recent content for anything that might be driving unfollows (too many stories? irrelevant content?). Consider a follower-retention strategy (polls, Q&As, exclusive content).
9. **Consider a small ad budget ($5–10/day):** Meta estimates $5/day could yield 2,283–6,598 Instagram reach daily. Even a modest boost on your best-performing posts could dramatically amplify organic results.
10. **Reduce bot/international follower dilution:** 27% non-US followers aren't customers. Avoid hashtag strategies that attract international engagement bots.

## 📌 Summary

This was a **strong bounce-back week** after a completely dormant Jan 18–24. The UGC influencer Reel was the standout driver, creating a massive spike in views (2,500+ on peak day) that the account hasn't seen all month. However, the net follower loss and the zero-content week before this one highlight a critical need for **consistency**. The audience is there (6K+ followers, 70% local women 25–44) — they just need regular reasons to engage.

**One-liner:** Great week powered by UGC, but consistency is the #1 thing holding this account back.
