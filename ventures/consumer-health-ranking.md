## 🎯 THE GAME PLAN

### The $10K Multi-Launch Strategy

| Priority | Idea | Budget | Expected Mo. 6 Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NOW** | GLP-1 Supplements | $4,000 | $5K-15K/mo |
| **Week 5** | Transdermal Patches | $2,500 | $2K-8K/mo |
| **Week 7** | Oral Microbiome Test | $3,000 | $2K-5K/mo |
| **Ongoing** | Marketing across all 3 | $500 | Compounds |
| | **TOTAL INVESTMENT** | **$10,000** | **$9K-28K/mo** |

### Phased Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Cash Flow (Weeks 1-6):** Launch GLP-1 supplements + transdermal patches. Troy builds everything. Revenue starts in 2-4 weeks. Same customer base, same brand.

**Phase 2 — Lab Leverage (Weeks 7-12):** Launch oral microbiome test MVP using Daniel's lab. Soft launch to IV therapy patients first. Add biomarker testing and epigenetic age test.

**Phase 3 — Hardware via Crowdfunding (Months 4-6):** Use supplement revenue + audience to fund 40Hz Gamma Device Kickstarter. Daniel's EEG expertise = unmatched credibility. Target $50K-100K campaign.

**Phase 4 — Portfolio Scale (Months 6-12):** 3-5 supplement/testing products generating recurring revenue. First hardware product shipping. Begin cold plunge controller or PBM helmet as second hardware play.

### The Unfair Advantages Stack

```
Daniel's Lab ──→ Cheapest testing in the market (80%+ margins)
  ├── Oral Microbiome Test
  ├── Biomarker Testing DTC  
  └── Epigenetic Age Test

Daniel's EEG Business ──→ Neuroscience credibility nobody can fake
  ├── 40Hz Gamma Device (validated with real EEG data)
  ├── PBM Brain Helmet
  └── Consumer EEG Headband (later)

Daniel's IV Therapy ──→ Built-in customer base + distribution
  ├── GLP-1 Supplements (cross-sell)
  ├── Transdermal Patches (sell at locations)
  └── Every supplement/test product

Troy (AI) ──→ $30K-80K of free labor
  ├── Builds websites, stores, apps
  ├── Creates all content + marketing
  ├── Manages operations + customer service
  └── Writes firmware for hardware prototypes
```

### Key Principle

> **Supplements are the launchpad, not the destination.** They generate cash, build audience, and fund the hardware/testing products that have real moats. A supplement brand is easy to copy. A 40Hz brain device validated with EEG data — backed by the guy who runs an EEG business — is NOT easy to copy.
