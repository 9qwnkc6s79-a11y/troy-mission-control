# VivPatch — US Transdermal Patch Contract Manufacturer Research

**Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Purpose:** Identify US-based contract manufacturers for vitamin/supplement transdermal patches classified as cosmetics under FDA  
**Status:** Initial Research Complete

---

## Executive Summary

The US transdermal patch contract manufacturing landscape is surprisingly niche. While pharmaceutical patch CDMOs abound, **manufacturers who specialize in nutraceutical/cosmetic vitamin patches are a small group** — roughly 6-8 companies nationwide. This is both a challenge (limited options) and an opportunity (less competition, manufacturers are hungry for new brands).

**Top 3 Recommendations for VivPatch (in priority order):**
1. 🥇 **The Tape Lab** — Best fit for a startup. White label program, custom formulation, fast turnaround, small MOQs, in California.
2. 🥈 **Meditech Innovations (Vision Meditech Group)** — 20 years patch-only focus, small MOQs, explicitly designed for new brands.
3. 🥉 **Hi-Tech Medical Products** — ISO/FDA certified, US + Mexico facilities, professional-grade manufacturing at competitive pricing.

## Key Outreach Template

When contacting manufacturers, ask about:

1. **Cosmetic classification experience** — Have they made patches classified as cosmetics under FDA FD&C Act?
2. **MOQs** — Minimum order quantities for first production run
3. **Custom formulation** — Can they develop custom formulas, or do you need to bring your own?
4. **Who owns the formula** — Critical for brand independence
5. **Certifications** — GMP, FDA registration, ISO certifications
6. **Timeline** — From first conversation to finished product
7. **Pricing structure** — Per-patch cost at various volumes
8. **Packaging options** — Individual pouches, sheets, boxes
9. **Printing** — Custom branding on patches and packaging
10. **Fulfillment** — Do they offer warehousing and direct-to-consumer shipping?

---

## Competitive Landscape Notes

- **PatchMD** retails at ~$25-40/30 patches ($0.83-1.33/patch retail)
- **Nutri-Patch** prices around $20-35/30 patches
- Both classify as **cosmetics** under FDA, not dietary supplements
- Key marketing language to note: "nourish your skin," "promote overall well-being" — **NOT** "absorbs into bloodstream" or "treats/cures"
- The cosmetic classification means:
  - No FDA pre-market approval needed
  - Cannot make drug claims (treat, cure, prevent disease)
  - Must follow cosmetic labeling requirements
  - Lower regulatory burden than supplements or drugs

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Email Meditech Innovations — request info packet and sample patches
- [ ] WhatsApp HWL Manufacturing — quick conversation about hydrogel option
- [ ] Draft VivPatch initial product line (which formulas to launch with)
