## Executive Summary

**VivPatch** is a premium direct-to-consumer (DTC) transdermal wellness patch brand targeting health-conscious consumers aged 25–45 who are seeking convenient, effective alternatives to traditional pills and capsules.

### The Opportunity
The global transdermal drug delivery market is valued at approximately **$8.0 billion in 2025** and is projected to reach **$13.4 billion by 2032**, growing at a **7.5% CAGR**. Within this, the consumer wellness patch segment is emerging as a high-growth niche, driven by "pill fatigue," biohacking culture, and the $60B+ dietary supplement market converging with novel delivery formats.

### The Problem
- **68% of Americans** take at least one dietary supplement, yet **compliance rates for daily pill regimens hover around 50%**
- Consumers experience pill fatigue, GI discomfort, and forget-to-take friction
- Existing transdermal supplement brands are either clinical/sterile in branding (PatchMD, PatchAid) or underdeveloped in formulation (The Patch Brand)
- **No brand owns the premium, lifestyle-forward position** in this category

### The Solution
VivPatch delivers science-backed wellness ingredients through medical-grade transdermal patches with **premium branding, superior formulations, and a lifestyle-driven brand identity**. Our core lineup — **Energy, Sleep, Calm, and Focus** — addresses the four most in-demand wellness states, while our specialty line (GLP-1 Support, NAD+, Hangover Recovery) captures high-margin trending categories.

### Key Differentiators
- **Premium brand identity** — Modern, clean, Instagram-native aesthetic vs. clinical/medical competitor branding
- **Superior formulations** — Multi-ingredient stacks with clinically-relevant dosages (not token amounts)
- **Cross-sell synergy** — Sister brand Noriva (GLP-1 supplements) creates a built-in acquisition channel
- **Dual-channel distribution** — DTC website + Amazon from Day 1
- **Subscription-first model** — 70%+ target subscription rate driving predictable revenue and high LTV

### Financial Highlights
| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 (Projected) |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| Revenue | $840K – $1.2M | $2.4M – $3.6M |
| Gross Margin | 72–76% | 74–78% |
| Customer Acquisition Cost | $22–28 | $18–24 |
| Average Order Value | $42–48 | $48–55 |
| Subscribers (End of Year) | 2,800–4,200 | 8,000–12,000 |

### Funding Ask
**$150,000** seed investment for inventory, brand development, initial marketing, and 6 months of operating runway. Break-even targeted at **Month 8–10**.

### 1. PatchMD — The Category Pioneer

**Website:** patchmd.com
**Founded:** ~2014 | **HQ:** Sherman Oaks, CA

**Product Range:** 113+ SKUs (largest in market)
- Multivitamins, B12 Energy, D3/K2, Sleep Starter, Focus Plus
- Specialty: GLP-1 Berberine, Metabolism Booster, Appetite Suppression
- Women's: Menopause Day/Night, PMS Relief, Anti-Aging, Acne
- Kids: Multivitamin + Omega-3
- Sports: Endurance Max
- Weight: Garcinia Cambogia, Metabolism

**Pricing:**
| Tier | One-Time | Subscription (40% off) |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| Standard patches (B12, Sleep, Focus, etc.) | $19.95/mo (30 patches) | $11.97/mo |
| Premium patches (GLP-1, Mito Cocktail, etc.) | $22.95/mo | $13.77/mo |
| 3-month bundles | $57.85 | $34.71 |

**Strengths:**
- ✅ First-mover advantage, established trust
- ✅ Massive SKU count covers every niche
- ✅ Strong SEO presence (ranks for "vitamin patches," "sleep patches," etc.)
- ✅ 594 reviews on Multivitamin alone; 140 on B12 Energy
- ✅ Doctor-recommended positioning
- ✅ Aggressive subscription discounting (40% off)

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Dated, clinical branding** — website feels medical/supplement-store, not lifestyle
- ❌ **SKU overload** — 113 products creates decision paralysis; no clear hero products
- ❌ **Low price positioning** — $11.97/mo subscription commoditizes the category
- ❌ **Weak social presence** — minimal TikTok/Instagram native content
- ❌ **Generic packaging** — white medical-style patches, uninspired retail presentation
- ❌ **Over-reliance on SEO** — vulnerable to algorithm shifts and DTC disruption
- ❌ **Questionable claims** — uses "may" language extensively; no strong clinical backing

**Customer Review Themes:**
- Positive: "Easy to use," "noticed more energy," "great for bariatric patients"
- Negative: "Patches fall off," "didn't notice difference," "adhesive issues," "overpriced for what you get"

**Market Position:** Legacy category leader with broad reach but vulnerable to modern brand competition.

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **Even more clinical than PatchMD** — hospital-grade aesthetic
- ❌ **Website is dense and overwhelming** — not optimized for casual browsers
- ❌ **Low brand awareness** outside bariatric community
- ❌ **Ingredient dosages appear low** — e.g., Berberine at 7mg (typical oral dose is 500–1500mg)

### Key Landing Page Insights (February 2026 Research)

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Channel Strategy: DTC + Amazon Dual-Channel

**Channel 1: DTC Website (Shopify Plus) — 60% of Revenue**
- Custom-designed Shopify store with subscription-first UX
- Quiz funnel: "Find Your Perfect Patch Stack" → personalized recommendation
- Subscription-first pricing (one-time price shown secondary)
- Strong content/education layer (how patches work, ingredient deep-dives)
- Integration with Recharge or Loop for subscription management
- SMS/email marketing via Klaviyo

**Channel 2: Amazon — 40% of Revenue**
- Launch on Amazon with Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA)
- Target keywords: "vitamin patches," "energy patches," "sleep patches," "supplement patches"
- Premium A+ Content with lifestyle imagery
- Amazon Subscribe & Save enrollment
- Vine program for initial reviews
- Amazon PPC with aggressive launch budget

**Why Dual-Channel:**
- Amazon captures "discovery" shoppers; DTC captures "loyalty" subscribers
- Amazon provides social proof (reviews) that enhances DTC conversion
- DTC provides higher margins (no Amazon fee) and customer ownership
- Hedges risk of platform dependency

## Appendix

### Key Assumptions & Risks

**Assumptions:**
1. Transdermal supplement patches continue gaining consumer acceptance
2. GLP-1 medication adoption continues growing (supporting companion supplement demand)
3. CAC remains within $20–30 range across channels
4. Manufacturing lead times remain stable (4–6 weeks)
5. No significant adverse regulatory action against supplement patches
6. Subscription retention rates at or above industry average (50%+)

**Key Risks & Mitigations:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| FDA reclassification/regulation | Low | High | Monitor regulatory landscape; maintain compliance buffer; diversify claims approach |
| Manufacturing supply disruption | Medium | High | Dual-source by Month 12; maintain 60-day safety stock |
| Below-target customer acquisition | Medium | High | Diversified channel strategy; influencer + paid + organic + cross-sell |
| Price war from PatchMD/PatchAid | Medium | Medium | Compete on brand/quality, not price; premium positioning insulates |
| Negative press about patch efficacy | Low | High | Third-party testing, transparent ingredient sourcing, clinical advisory board |
| Amazon account suspension | Low | High | Strict compliance, DTC as primary channel (60% revenue hedge) |

---

### Regulatory Notes

**FDA Classification:** Transdermal supplement patches exist in a regulatory gray area. They may be classified as:
1. **Dietary supplements** — if making structure/function claims
2. **Cosmetics** — if making only topical/skin claims
3. **Drugs** — if making disease prevention/treatment claims (AVOID)

**VivPatch Strategy:** Position as dietary supplement with structure/function claims only. All marketing materials reviewed for FTC and FDA compliance. No disease claims. Maintain "These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA" disclaimer on all products and marketing.
