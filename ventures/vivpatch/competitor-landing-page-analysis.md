# VivPatch Competitor Landing Page Analysis
**Research Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Objective:** Analyze competitor landing page strategies to identify opportunities for VivPatch differentiation

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the landing pages of the top 4 competitors (PatchMD, The Patch Brand, PatchAid, and Nutri-Patch), several key opportunities emerge for VivPatch:

### Key Findings:
1. **No competitor owns the premium lifestyle positioning** - all feel either clinical (PatchMD, PatchAid, Nutri-Patch) or underdeveloped (The Patch Brand)
2. **Weak social proof presentation** - reviews are buried or poorly displayed
3. **Confusing navigation** - especially PatchMD with 100+ products
4. **Poor mobile experience** across all competitors
5. **Weak value propositions** - focus on features, not benefits
6. **No clear subscription experience** - most treat it as afterthought

### VivPatch Opportunity:
Create a **premium, lifestyle-focused landing page** that feels like a modern DTC wellness brand (Ritual, Athletic Greens, Thorne) rather than a supplement store.
