---

### #3: SMP Nutra
**Why third:** Large stock formula catalog (800+), strong for fast launches, good for testing market with private label first

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [smpnutra.com](https://smpnutra.com) |
| **Location** | Edgewood, NY (BBB registered) |
| **Phone** | (833) 810-9896 (24/7) |
| **MOQ** | Low MOQs for stock formulas (as low as 100-500 units for private label); custom varies |
| **Lead Time** | Quote returned within 48-72 hours; production varies by order |
| **Custom Formulation** | ✅ Yes — custom capsule, powder, tablet, gummy, softgel manufacturing |

**Notes:** Great option for a **hybrid approach** — launch quickly with a stock GLP-1 support formula under your brand while developing a fully custom formulation. Their 800+ stock catalog likely includes berberine, chromium, and other GLP-1 support ingredients already formulated. Lowest barrier to entry.

---

### #4: Vitaquest International
**Why listed:** 45+ years in business, massive scale, 4,000+ custom formulas created

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [vitaquest.com](https://vitaquest.com) |
| **Location** | 8 Henderson Drive, West Caldwell, NJ 07006 (HQ); Manufacturing: 100 Jefferson Rd, Parsippany, NJ |

**Notes:** Better for later-stage scaling. MOQs and lead times don't fit your initial launch timeline. Keep in back pocket for when you're doing 25,000+ unit runs.

---

### #5: Vitalabs
**Why listed:** Lowest MOQ in the industry (72 bottles!), fast turnaround, custom formulation available

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [vitalabs.com](https://www.vitalabs.com) |
| **Location** | McDonough, GA (south of Atlanta) |
| **Phone** | 800-241-3017 |
| **MOQ** | **72 bottles per SKU** (stock formulas) — lowest in industry |

---

### BL Bio Lab (NOT in DFW — Clearwater, FL)
⚠️ **Correction:** BL Bio Lab is located in **Clearwater, Florida** (Tampa Bay area), not DFW Texas.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [blbiolab.com](https://blbiolab.com) |
| **Location** | Clearwater, FL — 75,000 sq ft facility |
| **Lead Time** | **8-12 weeks** (new products), **6-8 weeks** (reorders) |
| **MOQ** | Works with businesses of all sizes |
| **Custom Formulation** | ✅ Yes — in-house PhD biochemist team |
| **Certifications** | NSF GMP Certified (NSF/ANSI 455-2), ISO compliant |

**Verdict:** Too slow for your timeline (8-12 weeks for new products) and not local to DFW. Skip for initial run.

---

### NutraScience Labs (Farmingdale, NY)
⚠️ Website was unreachable during research. Known in industry as a solid contract manufacturer.
- **Website:** nutrasciencelabs.com
- **Location:** Farmingdale, NY
- **Reputation:** Well-known in the supplement manufacturing space
- **Action:** Try calling them directly; website may have been temporarily down

---

### Texas-Based Supplement Manufacturers
**Finding: There are very few supplement contract manufacturers in the DFW area.**

The Texas supplement manufacturing landscape is sparse compared to NY, CA, and FL. No major contract supplement manufacturer was found specifically in the DFW metroplex. Given that:
- Makers Nutrition ships nationally with 4-week turnaround
- Lief Labs is "Prime Ready" and ships to Amazon FBA anywhere
- SMP Nutra offers nationwide fulfillment

**Recommendation:** Don't limit your search to Texas. The national manufacturers above will serve you better. If proximity matters for quality checks, visit Makers Nutrition or Lief Labs in person once to establish the relationship.

---

## Product 2: Transdermal Patches

### Requirements Recap
- Caffeine, melatonin, B12, magnesium, CBD patches
- Custom formulations
- Low MOQs
- GMP certified

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT MARKET CONTEXT
The transdermal supplement patch industry is **very different** from traditional supplement manufacturing:

1. **Most patch companies are brands, not contract manufacturers** — PatchMD, PatchAid, Nutri-Patch, The Patch Brand all sell their own branded products
2. **True transdermal patch OEM/contract manufacturing is highly specialized** — fewer players, higher minimums
3. **FDA classification matters** — supplement patches are classified as **cosmetics** (not dietary supplements), which changes labeling/claims requirements
4. **Efficacy claims are limited** — you cannot claim transdermal vitamin absorption under current FDA rules for cosmetic products

---

### ⭐ #1 RECOMMENDATION: PatchMD (White-Label/Partnership Inquiry)
**Why first:** Already manufactures 30+ patch SKUs including a **GLP-1 Berberine patch**, proven formulations, strong brand

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [patchmd.com](https://www.patchmd.com) |
| **Location** | USA-based |
| **Products** | 30+ patches: B12, sleep (melatonin), energy (caffeine), magnesium (Magna Calm), GLP-1 Berberine, multivitamin, focus, immune defense, NAD+, and more |
| **Retail Price** | $13.99-24.99 per 30-day supply (retail) |
| **Contract Mfg?** | **Not publicly advertised** — but worth inquiring about white-label or co-manufacturing |

**Action Required:** Contact PatchMD directly and ask:
1. Do you offer white-label manufacturing or contract manufacturing for other brands?
2. Can we license your formulations under our brand?
3. What are wholesale/bulk pricing tiers?

**Note:** PatchMD already has exactly the products you want (GLP-1 Berberine, B12, sleep, magnesium). If they won't white-label, consider becoming a **wholesale distributor** with custom branding.

---

### ⭐ #2 RECOMMENDATION: Nutri-Patch (White-Label Inquiry)
**Why second:** Made in USA, contract manufacturer relationship already in place

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [nutri-patch.com](https://www.nutri-patch.com) |
| **Location** | Stamford, Connecticut (company HQ); manufacturing via US-based contract partner |
| **Products** | Vitamin-infused topical patches, 12-hour continuous release |
| **Features** | Hypoallergenic, paraben-free, latex-free, non-toxic, non-GMO |
| **Founded by** | Naturopathic physician at a university medical school |
| **Contract Mfg?** | They USE a contract manufacturer — ask who it is or if they'll manufacture for you |

**Action Required:** Contact Nutri-Patch and ask:
1. Who manufactures your patches? (Their contract manufacturer may take outside clients)
2. Are you interested in a white-label/private-label partnership?

---

### #3: PatchAid
**Why listed:** Established brand with 3M adhesive technology, clean formulations

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [patchaid.com](https://patchaid.com) |
| **Products** | Energy, focus, sleep, libido, calm, daily immunity, recovery, pimple patches |
| **Technology** | Premium 3M hypoallergenic fabric for transdermal applications, multidirectional elasticity |
| **Structure** | 3-layer system: Backing (protects nutrients), Formula Layer (vitamins, no binders/fillers), Contact Layer (heat-activated) |
| **Contract Mfg?** | Consumer brand — inquire about white-label options |

---

### #4: Alibaba/Overseas OEM Manufacturing
For **lowest cost** custom patch manufacturing, Chinese and Korean OEM factories are the primary option:

**Recommended Search Strategy:**
1. Go to Alibaba.com and search "transdermal vitamin patch OEM" or "supplement patch manufacturer"
2. Filter by: Gold Supplier, Verified, 5+ years, GMP certified
3. Look for factories with existing vitamin/supplement patch experience

**Typical Alibaba Pricing:**
- Custom vitamin patches: $0.10-0.50 per patch
- MOQ: 10,000-50,000 patches per formulation
- Lead time: 4-8 weeks (including shipping)
- Customization: Full custom formulations, packaging, branding

**Top categories to search:**
- "Caffeine energy patch OEM"
- "Melatonin sleep patch manufacturer"
- "B12 vitamin patch factory"
- "CBD transdermal patch OEM"

**⚠️ Risks:** Quality control, longer shipping times, communication barriers, regulatory compliance. Recommend ordering samples from 3-5 suppliers before committing.

---

### #5: Noven Pharmaceuticals (Pharmaceutical-Grade — Reference Only)
| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [noven.com](https://www.noven.com) |
| **Location** | Miami, FL |
| **Products** | Prescription transdermal systems (Xelstrym, Daytrana, Minivelle) |
| **Relevance** | Pharmaceutical transdermal manufacturer — **not for supplement patches** |

**Verdict:** Too pharmaceutical/high-end for supplement patches. Included for reference only. If you ever pursue FDA-approved drug patches, Noven is the partner.

---

### BioDelivery Sciences
**Status:** Could not access website. BioDelivery Sciences was acquired by **Collegium Pharmaceutical** in 2022. They focused on pharmaceutical drug delivery, not supplement contract manufacturing. **Not relevant** for your use case.

---

### Transdermal Patch — Recommended Strategy

Given the limited contract manufacturing options for supplement patches in the US:

1. **Short-term (Fastest to market):** Partner with PatchMD or Nutri-Patch for white-label/wholesale
2. **Medium-term:** Source a Chinese/Korean OEM manufacturer via Alibaba for custom formulations
3. **Long-term:** Once you identify a reliable overseas manufacturer, consider bringing manufacturing closer to home

**Estimated Costs per Patch (30-day supply pouch of 30 patches):**
- White-label from US brand: $4-8 wholesale per pouch
- Alibaba OEM: $2-5 per pouch (shipped, at 10K+ units)
- Retail price opportunity: $19.99-29.99 per pouch

---

## Product 3: Epigenetic Age Testing

### Requirements Recap
- DNA methylation arrays for biological age testing
- White-label options
- Cost per test
- What a test kit needs to include
- Lab partnership options

---

### What Equipment Is Needed?

**Core Equipment for DNA Methylation Arrays:**
1. **Illumina iScan System** — ~$150,000-250,000 (reads the BeadChip arrays)
2. **Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 Kits** — pricing requires Illumina account login
   - Available in 8, 16, 32, and 96 sample configurations
   - Requires 250 ng DNA input
   - Bisulfite conversion kits purchased separately
   - **Estimated cost: $200-350 per sample** (array + reagents)
3. **Bisulfite conversion kit** (e.g., Zymo Research EZ DNA Methylation Kit) — ~$5-15 per sample
4. **DNA extraction equipment** — standard molecular biology lab setup
5. **Bioinformatics pipeline** — software to calculate epigenetic clocks (GrimAge, DunedinPACE, PhenoAge, etc.)
6. **CLIA certification** — required if processing clinical samples in the US

**Total Equipment Investment:** $200,000-350,000+ for in-house capability

### Can Daniel's Existing Lab Run These?
**Likely not without significant investment.** Running Illumina arrays requires:
- Illumina iScan or NextSeq system
- Trained technicians experienced with methylation arrays
- CLIA certification for clinical testing
- Quality management system
- Bioinformatics team for data analysis and clock calculation

**Recommendation: Partner with an existing CLIA-certified lab rather than building in-house.** This saves $300K+ in equipment and 12+ months in CLIA certification.

---

### What Does a Test Kit Include?
A direct-to-consumer epigenetic age test kit typically includes:
1. **Blood collection device** — finger-prick lancet + blood collection card (TruDiagnostic uses this) OR
2. **Saliva collection tube** — easier for consumer, but blood generally preferred for methylation
3. **Collection instructions** — step-by-step guide with images
4. **Prepaid return mailer** — FedEx or USPS prepaid envelope/box
5. **Biohazard bag** — for the sample
6. **Unique barcode/activation card** — links physical kit to digital account
7. **Consent form** — required for processing
8. **Branded packaging** — outer box with your brand

**Cost per kit (physical components only):** $8-15 per kit (lancet, tube, mailer, packaging)

---

- Centralized portal dashboard for managing patients and results

**Action Required:**
1. Apply as a provider at trudiagnostic.com/provider-application
2. Ask specifically about: white-label options, volume pricing, custom branding on reports
3. Even if they don't white-label, the provider model lets you resell at markup under your brand's ecosystem

**Estimated Provider Cost:** $100-175 per test at volume (estimated based on typical wholesale discounts from retail pricing)

---

### ⭐ #2 RECOMMENDATION: Clock Foundation / MyAgingTests.com
**Why second:** Founded by Steve Horvath (creator of the Horvath Clock), research-grade, clinic/provider tools, lower cost

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [clockfoundation.org](https://clockfoundation.org) / [myagingtests.com](https://myagingtests.com) |
| **Location** | Los Angeles, CA |
| **Founded by** | Steve Horvath (UCLA Professor) & Bobby Brooke |
| **Status** | 501(c) nonprofit — research-oriented |
| **Tests Available** | GrimAge epigenetic test, PhenoAge clinical test, wearables monitoring |
| **Pricing** | |
| — GrimAge Test | **$325** (on sale from $499) — one-time DNA test with at-home collection |
| — PhenoAge Test | **$75** — lab blood test |
| — Monthly Plan | **$150/mo** — includes PhenoAge (4x/yr), GrimAge (2x/yr), wearables tracking |
| **Turnaround** | 4-6 weeks from collection |
| **For Clinics** | ✅ Doctor/researcher signup available, bulk ordering, patient portal |

2. Ask about: white-label DTC test kits, volume pricing for 100+ tests, custom branding
3. Their premium provider tier explicitly mentions "custom offerings for DTC testing" — this is likely your white-label path

**Estimated Provider Cost:** $150-250 per GrimAge test at volume

---

### #3: Zymo Research (Reagent Supplier, Not Testing Partner)
| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [zymoresearch.com](https://www.zymoresearch.com) |
| **Location** | Irvine, CA |
| **Relevance** | Sells DNA methylation research reagents — bisulfite conversion kits, methylation standards, enzymes |
| **Products** | EZ DNA Methylation kits (most cited in industry), sample collection kits, DNA/RNA Shield |
| **OEM/Custom** | They offer OEM & custom manufacturing of reagents |

**Verdict:** Zymo is a **reagent supplier**, not a testing service. Useful if you build in-house lab capability. Their DNA/RNA Shield Saliva Collection Kit could be the physical kit component. Not a testing partner.

---

### #4: Illumina (Equipment/Array Manufacturer)
| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [illumina.com](https://www.illumina.com) |
| **Product** | Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 Kit |
| **Configurations** | 8, 16, 32, 96 sample kits + semi-custom options |
| **Pricing** | Requires login — estimated $200-350/sample depending on volume |
| **Equipment** | iScan system required for reading arrays |

**Verdict:** Illumina makes the platform, not the consumer-facing service. You'd only deal with Illumina directly if building an in-house lab.

---

### Epigenetic Testing — Recommended Strategy

**Option A: White-Label Partnership (Recommended for Speed)**
1. Partner with TruDiagnostic or Clock Foundation as a provider
2. Create your branded test kit packaging (outer box, instructions)
3. Include their collection kit inside your branded package
4. Customers order through your website → kit ships → sample returns to their lab
5. Results delivered through their portal or via API to your app
6. **Time to market: 4-8 weeks** (mostly branding and website work)
7. **Cost per test: $100-200** (wholesale) → **sell at $249-349**

**Option B: Full In-House Lab (Not Recommended Short-Term)**
1. Purchase Illumina iScan + MethylationEPIC kits
2. Hire lab technicians, bioinformatician
3. Get CLIA certification (6-12+ months)
4. Build bioinformatics pipeline
5. **Investment: $300,000-500,000+**
6. **Time to market: 12-18 months**

**Clear winner: Option A.** Start as a provider/reseller, build volume and brand, then consider in-house lab when doing 1,000+ tests/month.
