## 4. Customer Acquisition Economics

### 4.1 CAC by Channel

| Channel | CAC Range | Blended CAC Target | % of New Customers (Yr 1) |
|---------|----------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **Organic/SEO** | $8-12 | $10 | 20% |

- Month 4-6: $28-35 (optimizing winners, growing organic)
- Month 7-12: $22-28 (mature channels, strong organic/SEO, influencer flywheel)
- Year 2: $18-24 (brand awareness, word-of-mouth, provider referrals)

### 4.2 CAC Calculation Detail — Paid Channels

**Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads:**

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Aggressive |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions) | $18 | $15 | $12 |
| CTR (click-through rate) | 1.2% | 1.5% | 2.0% |
| CPC (cost per click) | $1.50 | $1.00 | $0.60 |
| Landing Page Conversion Rate | 2.5% | 3.5% | 5.0% |
| CAC | $60 | $29 | $12 |
| **Modeled CAC** | | **$32** | |

**Google Search Ads:**

| Metric | Conservative | Base | Aggressive |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|

| Conversion Rate | 4.0% | 6.0% | 8.0% |
| CAC | $88 | $42 | $23 |
| **Modeled CAC** | | **$38** | |

*Note: Google CPC for "GLP-1 supplements" and "Ozempic vitamins" keywords are currently relatively low (low competition) — this is a significant early-mover advantage that will increase as competitors enter.*

## 9. Capital Requirements & Use of Funds

### 9.1 Startup Capital Budget

**Total Required: $100,000 – $150,000**

| Category | Amount | % of Total |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Product Development & Manufacturing | $41,000-76,000 | 41-51% |

| Marketing (First 3 months) | $23,000-43,000 | 23-29% |
| Operations & Legal | $22,000-42,000 | 22-28% |

*Detailed line items in business-plan.md, Section 10.1*

### 9.2 Cash Needs Before Revenue

**Pre-Launch Cash Outflow (Months -4 to 0):**

| Month | Outflow | Cumulative |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Month -4 | $15,000 (legal, brand, formulation) | ($15,000) |
| Month -3 | $20,000 (website, content, manufacturer deposit) | ($35,000) |
| Month -2 | $25,000 (production run payment, influencer seeding) | ($60,000) |
| Month -1 | $20,000 (production balance, PR, pre-launch marketing) | ($80,000) |
| **Total Pre-Launch** | **$80,000** | |

**Post-Launch Cash Gap (Months 1-4):**

| Month | Revenue | Expenses | Net Cash | Cumulative from Start |
|-------|---------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| Month 1 | $13,750 | $32,129 | ($18,379) | ($98,379) |
| Month 2 | $23,500 | $36,842 | ($13,342) | ($111,721) |
| Month 3 | $39,500 | $49,186 | ($9,685) | ($121,406) |
| Month 4 | $62,500 | $65,773 | ($3,273) | ($124,679) |

**Maximum Cash Needed (Peak Negative):** ~$125,000 (Month 4)

This confirms the $100-150K capital requirement, with $125K being the optimal target to provide adequate runway without excess idle capital.

### 9.3 Inventory Investment Schedule

| Production Run | Timing | Units/SKU | Total Units | Investment |
|---------------|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Run 1 (Launch) | Month -2 | 5,000 | 20,000 | $35,000-50,000 |
| Run 2 (Reorder) | Month 2-3 | 5,000 | 20,000 | $35,000-50,000 |
| Run 3 (Scale) | Month 5-6 | 10,000 | 40,000 | $60,000-80,000 |
| Run 4 | Month 8-9 | 15,000 | 60,000 | $80,000-100,000 |

*Note: Production runs 2+ are funded from operating revenue. Only Run 1 requires startup capital.*

### 10.2 Cash Flow Challenge: Inventory Timing

The cash flow forecast reveals a critical insight: **inventory reorder costs create cash flow troughs** even when the business is operationally profitable. Key observations:

- **Month 6 and Month 9:** Large inventory purchases create temporary negative cash positions
- **This is normal** for product businesses scaling rapidly
- **Mitigation strategies:**
  1. **Negotiate payment terms** with manufacturer (Net 30 or Net 45 vs. upfront)
  2. **Revenue-based financing** (Shopify Capital, Clearco) to fund inventory at Month 5-6
  3. **Pre-sell annual subscriptions** for upfront cash
  4. **Stagger production runs** across SKUs (don't reorder all 4 at once)

### 10.3 Revised Cash Flow with Financing

**If manufacturer offers Net 30 terms starting Month 3 and Shopify Capital provides $50K at Month 6:**

| Month | Cash Position (No Financing) | Cash Position (With Financing) |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Month 1 | $106,621 | $106,621 |
| Month 3 | $43,593 | $63,593 |
| Month 6 | ($19,134) | $50,866 |
| Month 9 | ($45,866) | $14,134 |
| Month 12 | ($17,664) | $52,336 |

**Recommendation:** Secure Net 30 payment terms with manufacturer by Month 3 (once order history is established) and line up $50K revenue-based financing by Month 5-6 to bridge inventory scaling.

## Summary & Key Takeaways

### The Numbers Tell a Strong Story:

1. **Unit Economics Are Exceptional:** 70-75% product gross margins, sub-$30 blended CAC, 14x+ LTV:CAC ratio, and <1 month payback period. These are best-in-class metrics for DTC supplements.

2. **Capital Efficiency:** $100-150K gets Noriva to market with inventory, brand, and initial marketing. Monthly break-even is achievable by Month 5 with ~750 subscribers. The business is designed to be self-funding after the initial investment.

3. **The Bundle Is the Key:** Bundle subscribers represent 35% of the customer base but drive disproportionate revenue and have 25-30% better retention. GTM should emphasize The Bundle as the primary offering.

4. **Marketing Efficiency Improves Over Time:** Year 1 marketing spend is 33% of revenue (acquisition-heavy); by Year 3, it drops to 25% as organic, SEO, referral, and B2B channels mature. This expanding margin creates the path to 20%+ EBITDA.

5. **Cash Flow Requires Attention:** Inventory reorder timing creates cash flow troughs. Securing manufacturer payment terms and having access to revenue-based financing by Month 5-6 is important.

6. **Multiple Paths to Attractive Returns:** Even the conservative scenario ($600K Year 1, $5M Year 3) builds a profitable, growing supplement brand. The base case ($1.34M Year 1, $12M Year 3) positions Noriva as a category leader. The aggressive case ($2M Year 1, $25M Year 3) makes Noriva an attractive acquisition target at 5-8x revenue multiples.

### Return on Investment Summary

| Scenario | Investment | Year 3 Revenue | Year 3 EBITDA | Implied Valuation (4x Rev) | ROI |
|----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|-----|
| Conservative | $125K | $5M | $800K | $20M | 160x |
| Base Case | $125K | $12M | $2.8M | $48M | 384x |
| Aggressive | $125K | $25M | $5.5M | $100M | 800x |

*Note: Valuations are illustrative. Actual multiples depend on growth rate, profitability, competitive position, and market conditions. DTC supplement brands typically trade at 3-6x revenue; high-growth subscription brands can command 5-10x.*
