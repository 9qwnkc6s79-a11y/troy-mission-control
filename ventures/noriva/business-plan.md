## 1. Executive Summary

**Noriva** is a direct-to-consumer supplement brand purpose-built for the 30M+ Americans currently taking GLP-1 receptor agonist medications (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, Zepbound). These medications cause clinically documented nutrient depletion, muscle loss, gastrointestinal distress, and hair/skin changes — yet no trusted, comprehensive supplement brand exists to serve this massive and rapidly growing population.

### The Problem
GLP-1 medications are the largest pharmaceutical disruption in a generation, with $50B+ in annual global sales and 25-35% annual growth. But patients face serious nutritional challenges:
- **60%+** consume below estimated calcium and iron requirements
- **25-40%** of weight lost is lean body mass, not fat
- **40-50%** experience nausea, bloating, or constipation
- **Hair loss** is increasingly documented as a significant adverse effect
- Doctors say "take a multivitamin" — but generic vitamins aren't designed for drastically reduced caloric intake

### The Solution
Noriva offers a **4-product nutrition system** specifically formulated for GLP-1 patients:
1. **Essential Multi** — Enhanced multivitamin for reduced caloric intake
2. **Muscle Guard** — HMB, creatine, and leucine for lean mass preservation
3. **Gut Ease** — Ginger, probiotics, and enzymes for GI comfort
4. **Hair + Glow** — Biotin, collagen, and iron for hair/skin/nail health

**Pricing:** $44.99/month per product | $129.99/month for The Bundle (all 4)

### The Opportunity
- **TAM:** $36B+ (15M active GLP-1 users × supplement spend potential)
- **SAM:** $10.7B (DTC-reachable, income-qualified, awareness-adjusted)
- **Year 1 Target:** $1.2M revenue (base case) from ~2,200 active subscribers
- **Gross Margins:** 70-75% on individual products
- **Capital Required:** $100-150K to launch

### Why Now
- The GLP-1 patient population is doubling every 18-24 months
- Clinical research on GLP-1 nutritional deficiencies is exploding (peer-reviewed studies tripled in 2025)
- No brand owns the "GLP-1 supplement" category — the market is fragmented with generic products
- AG1 is already targeting GLP-1 users on their homepage — validation that the category is real
- Oral GLP-1 formulations (removing needle barrier) will expand the addressable market by 20-30M users by 2030

### Why Noriva
- **Purpose-built** for GLP-1 patients (not a generic supplement with a new label)
- **Clinically formulated** with premium ingredient forms and therapeutic doses
- **4-product system** creates switching costs and higher LTV vs. single-product competitors
- **Education-first brand** building SEO and content moat
- **Subscription model** with 70%+ gross margins and predictable recurring revenue

## 3. Products & Pricing

### 3.1 Product Suite

Noriva's launch portfolio consists of four complementary products and one bundle, each addressing a distinct clinical challenge faced by GLP-1 medication users:

| Product | Target Challenge | Format | Subscription | One-Time |
|---------|-----------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Essential Multi** | Nutrient depletion from reduced caloric intake | Capsules (3/day) | $44.99/mo | $49.99 |
| **Muscle Guard** | Lean mass loss (25-40% of weight lost) | Powder stick packs | $44.99/mo | $49.99 |

*Full formulations with clinical references available in product-suite.md*

### 3.2 Key Formulation Differentiators

- **Premium ingredient forms:** Methylcobalamin (not cyanocobalamin), Quatrefolic® L-5-MTHF (not folic acid), ferrous bisglycinate (not ferrous sulfate), Creapure® creatine, myHMB®
- **Clinical dosing:** Therapeutic doses validated by peer-reviewed research, not "pixie-dust" label decoration
- **GLP-1 specificity:** Every ingredient tied to a documented GLP-1 nutritional challenge
- **Branded ingredients:** myHMB®, Creapure®, Quatrefolic®, MenaQ7®, PepZin GI®, OptiMSM® — patented, clinically studied ingredients

### 3.3 Pricing Strategy

**Subscribe & Save Model:**
- Subscription pricing ($44.99/$129.99) is the primary offer, representing 10% savings vs. one-time pricing
- Subscription locks in recurring revenue and dramatically increases LTV
- Bundle pricing ($129.99 vs. $179.96 for 4 individual) provides 28% savings — marketed as "save 35%" vs. one-time individual pricing
- First-month promotional pricing considered for acquisition: Bundle at $99.99 (first month only)

**Price Positioning:**
- Below AG1 ($79/mo for a single greens powder)
- Above generic Amazon GLP-1 supplements ($15-45)
- Comparable to Ritual ($36-44/product) and Elo Health ($60-90/mo)
- Bundle positions as strong value vs. building a DIY Thorne stack ($100-200+/mo)

### 3.4 Product Roadmap

## 4. Market Opportunity

*Detailed analysis available in market-analysis.md*

### 4.1 The GLP-1 Revolution

GLP-1 receptor agonists are the largest pharmaceutical disruption since statins. The combined GLP-1 market (Novo Nordisk + Eli Lilly) exceeded **$50 billion in global annual sales in 2025**, with projections of **$100-150 billion by 2030** (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley).

**Current US Patient Population:**
- **30M+** Americans have ever taken a GLP-1 medication (KFF Health Tracking Poll, 2024)
- **~15.6M** are currently taking a GLP-1 drug
- **82%** of US adults have heard of GLP-1 drugs
- Patient population is **doubling every 18-24 months**

**Growth Catalysts:**
- Oral GLP-1 formulations (removing needle barrier) — could add 20-30M users by 2030
- Expanding indications: heart disease, MASH/NASH, Alzheimer's, kidney disease, sleep apnea
- Medicare coverage expansion (bipartisan support, 60% of Americans favor)
- Generic/biosimilar entry lowering prices post-2031
- Pipeline drugs from Amgen, Viking, Pfizer, Roche expanding competition and access

### 4.2 Market Sizing

| Market Level | Calculation | Size |
|-------------|-------------|------|
| **TAM** | 15M active users × 40% supplement buyers × $50/mo avg × 12 months | **$36B** |
| **SAM** | TAM filtered by DTC (65%), income ($75K+ HHI, 55%), awareness (30%) | **$10.7B** |
| **SOM Year 1** | 2,000-5,000 subscribers × $75/mo avg ARR | **$1.8-4.5M** |
| **SOM Year 3** | 30,000-75,000 subscribers × $75/mo avg ARR | **$27-67.5M** |

### 4.3 Category Comparison

The "prenatal vitamin" analogy is powerful and instructive:

| Metric | Prenatal Vitamins | GLP-1 Supplements (Noriva) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| US Market Size | $2.5B (2025) | Nascent — targeting $50M+ in 3 years |
| Target Population | ~3.6M pregnancies/year | 15M+ active GLP-1 users (and growing) |
| Clinical Need | Documented nutrient needs during pregnancy | Documented nutrient depletion, muscle loss, GI issues |
| Doctor Recommendation | Standard of care | Emerging — growing clinical evidence |
| Price Range | $15-50/month | $44.99-129.99/month |
| Growth Driver | Stable birth rate | 25-35% CAGR in GLP-1 adoption |

The GLP-1 supplement opportunity is **4x larger** than prenatal vitamins by addressable population and growing at **10x the rate**.

## 6. Competitive Positioning

*Full competitive analysis available in competitor-analysis.md*

### 6.1 Competitive Landscape

The GLP-1 supplement market sits at the intersection of three categories, none of which fully serve the opportunity:

| Category | Key Players | Approach | Limitation |
|----------|------------|----------|------------|
| **GLP-1-Specific Brands** | Elo Health, Vitauthority | GLP-1-labeled products | Limited systems, generic formulations, high friction (Elo) or low quality (Vitauthority) |
| **Premium DTC Supplements** | AG1, Ritual, Thorne | General wellness, repositioning for GLP-1 | Not purpose-built; can't adequately dose GLP-1-specific needs in existing formats |
| **GLP-1 Telehealth Platforms** | Hims/Hers, Found, Noom | Medication first, supplements as afterthought | Generic add-ons, no formulation expertise, competing priorities |

### 6.2 Noriva's Unique Position

**"The only comprehensive, clinically formulated supplement system designed exclusively for GLP-1 patients."**

| Competitive Dimension | Noriva | AG1 | Elo Health | Vitauthority | Thorne (DIY) |
|----------------------|--------|-----|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| GLP-1-Specific | ✅ Purpose-built | ⚠️ Repositioned | ✅ Pivoted | ⚠️ Relabeled | ❌ Generic |
| Comprehensive System | ✅ 4 products | ❌ 1 product | ❌ Gummies only | ⚠️ Fragmented | ❌ DIY required |
| Clinical Depth | ✅ Peer-reviewed citations | ⚠️ Own studies | ⚠️ AI-driven | ❌ None | ✅ Research-backed |
| Ingredient Quality | ✅ Premium/branded | ⚠️ Proprietary blend | ⚠️ Gummy limits | ❌ Basic forms | ✅ Premium |
| Monthly Cost (full coverage) | $129.99 | $79 (partial) | $60-90 (partial) | $80-130 | $100-200+ |
| Switching Cost | High (system) | Low (single product) | Medium (personalization) | Low | Low |

### 6.3 Key Market Gaps Noriva Fills

1. **No Comprehensive System** — Nobody offers a coordinated 4-product system addressing all four GLP-1 challenges
2. **No Clinical Credibility** — Most GLP-1 supplements don't cite clinical evidence
3. **No Premium Ingredient Forms** — Cheap ingredient forms are particularly problematic for patients with altered absorption
4. **No Education-First Brand** — GLP-1 patients are desperate for trustworthy information
5. **No GLP-1 Subscription Experience** — Journey-based lifecycle marketing is absent
6. **No Healthcare Provider Channel** — Doctors want to recommend something specific; nothing exists

### 6.4 Defensible Moat

| Moat Layer | Time to Replicate |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "GLP-1 supplement system" positioning and brand | 12-18 months |
| 4-product architecture with system switching costs | 12-18 months |
| SEO/content authority on GLP-1 nutrition | 6-12 months |
| Telehealth and provider B2B partnerships | 12-24 months |
| Clinical credibility (peer-reviewed citations) | 12-24 months |
| Subscription community and lifecycle marketing | 12-18 months |

### 10.2 Funding Sources

**Option A: Self-Funded (Bootstrap)**
- Founder capital: $100-150K
- Pros: Full ownership, no dilution, fast decision-making
- Cons: Personal financial risk, limited capital for scaling
- **Recommended for initial launch** — supplement brands can be capital-efficient

**Option B: Friends & Family / Angel Round**
- Raise: $150-250K at $1-2M pre-money valuation
- Pros: More runway for marketing, reduced personal risk
- Cons: Dilution (10-20%), investor management
- **Consider if founder wants to de-risk and scale marketing faster**

**Option C: Revenue-Based Financing (Post-Launch)**
- Providers: Clearco, Pipe, Shopify Capital
- Borrow against future revenue to fund inventory and marketing
- Pros: No dilution, available once revenue is flowing
- Cons: Higher effective cost of capital, reduces near-term cash flow
- **Best option for scaling from $50K/mo to $200K/mo revenue**

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Bootstrap launch with $100-150K founder capital
2. Reach $30-50K/month revenue (validation)
3. Raise angel round ($250-500K) or use revenue-based financing to scale
4. Re-evaluate Series A ($2-5M) at $1M+ ARR for aggressive growth

## 12. Risk Factors & Mitigation

### 12.1 Market & Regulatory Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **FDA scrutiny of "GLP-1 support" claims** | Medium | High | FDA-compliant labeling reviewed by supplement attorney. Use structure/function claims only ("supports digestive health") — never disease claims ("prevents Ozempic side effects"). Include required disclaimer. |
| **GLP-1 medication safety scare** | Low-Medium | High | Noriva's supplements have value independent of any specific medication. Position as "nutrition for people with reduced caloric intake" — applicable beyond GLP-1. Diversify messaging. |
| **Economic downturn reduces supplement spend** | Medium | Medium | Subscription model creates habit/stickiness. Bundle pricing provides perceived value. Essential Multi ($44.99) serves as affordable entry point. Focus on clinical necessity, not luxury positioning. |
| **GLP-1 medication becomes less popular** | Very Low | High | Every pipeline drug (Amgen, Viking, Pfizer, Roche) validates the category. Multiple indications expanding beyond weight loss. Even if one drug fails, the GLP-1 class is growing. |

### 12.2 Competitive Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **AG1 or major brand launches GLP-1 line** | Medium | High | First-mover advantage: 12+ months of brand building, SEO, and community before they can launch. System approach (4 products) is harder to replicate. Single-product brands can't match depth. |
| **Hims/Hers launches GLP-1 supplements** | High | Medium | Position for B2B partnership (we become their supplement supplier). Our formulation depth > their generic add-ons. They're medication-first; we're nutrition-first. |
| **Race to bottom on Amazon** | High | Low | Amazon is a channel, not the strategy. DTC subscription creates loyalty. Brand quality and education differentiate from commodity competitors. |
| **VC-funded competitor with more capital** | Medium | Medium | Capital-efficient launch and focus on organic/content marketing (cheaper to acquire) vs. pure paid acquisition (expensive to scale). Community and clinical trust are not easily bought. |

### 12.3 Operational Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Supply chain disruption (ingredient shortage)** | Low-Medium | High | Dual-source critical ingredients. 60-90 day safety stock. Domestic manufacturing reduces import risk. Branded ingredient suppliers have dedicated supply chains. |
| **Contract manufacturer quality issue** | Low | Very High | Independent third-party testing every batch. COAs published publicly. Product liability insurance. Multiple manufacturer relationships as backup. |
| **Subscription churn higher than projected** | Medium | Medium | Journey-based lifecycle marketing. Community building. Cross-sell opportunities increase stickiness. Proactive churn prevention (pause option, downsell to lower tier before cancel). |
| **Shipping/fulfillment delays** | Low-Medium | Medium | Multi-warehouse 3PL (Phase 2). Safety stock management. Proactive customer communication. Subscription flexibility (skip/delay). |

### 12.4 Financial Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **CAC higher than projected** | Medium | Medium | Content/SEO strategy provides low-CAC organic acquisition. Influencer affiliates provide performance-based (lower-risk) paid channels. Test ads with small budget before scaling. |
| **Slower subscriber growth** | Medium | Medium | Low fixed costs and capital-efficient model means breakeven is achievable at ~800 subscribers. Lean operations until product-market fit is validated. |
| **Cash flow crunch from inventory investment** | Low-Medium | Medium | Start with small production runs (5,000 units). Revenue-based financing available post-revenue. Subscription prepayment model provides cash flow visibility. |

## 13. Strategic Synergies

### 13.1 VivPatch — Sister Brand Cross-Sell

**VivPatch** is a transdermal wellness patch brand within Daniel's portfolio. The cross-sell synergy between Noriva and VivPatch is significant:

**Potential VivPatch Products for GLP-1 Patients:**
- **B12 Transdermal Patch** — Bypasses GI absorption entirely (ideal for patients with altered gastric function)
- **Energy Patch** — B-vitamins + caffeine for GLP-1 patients experiencing fatigue
- **Sleep Patch** — Melatonin + magnesium for sleep disruption during weight loss
- **Anti-Nausea Patch** — Ginger + peppermint for acute GLP-1 nausea relief

**Cross-Sell Strategy:**
- Noriva customers receive VivPatch samples in subscription boxes
- VivPatch customers receive Noriva discount codes
- Shared content marketing (education about transdermal delivery for GLP-1 patients)
- Bundled offerings on both websites
- Shared email/SMS list (with opt-in consent)
- Combined influencer partnerships

**Revenue Impact:**
- Estimated 10-15% of Noriva subscribers will purchase VivPatch products
- Estimated 5-10% of VivPatch customers will try Noriva
- Cross-sell adds $5-15/month additional revenue per customer

### 13.2 Health & Wellness Portfolio Fit

Noriva fits within Daniel's existing health investment portfolio:

| Portfolio Investment | Synergy with Noriva |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Lab Testing** | Noriva Lab Panel (Phase 3) could partner with existing lab testing relationships. Blood test → personalized supplement recommendation. |
| **EEG Scans** | Cognitive health monitoring. GLP-1 patients report brain fog — could inform future "Cognitive Support" product. |
| **IV Therapy** | IV nutrient infusion for severely depleted GLP-1 patients. "Noriva IV" protocol for rapid repletion. Cross-refer patients. |
| **VivPatch** | Transdermal delivery of key nutrients. B12 patch for GLP-1 patients with impaired GI absorption. |

**Ecosystem Vision:** Daniel's health portfolio creates a comprehensive wellness ecosystem:
1. **Diagnose** (lab testing, EEG) → identify deficiencies
2. **Supplement** (Noriva) → daily nutritional support
3. **Deliver** (VivPatch) → transdermal alternatives
4. **Treat** (IV therapy) → acute repletion when needed

This ecosystem approach is defensible and creates multiple touchpoints with health-conscious consumers.

### 13.3 Future M&A / Exit Opportunities

GLP-1 supplement brands at scale are attractive acquisition targets for:

| Potential Acquirer | Strategic Rationale |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **GLP-1 Telehealth Platforms** (Hims, Found, Ro) | Add high-margin supplement revenue to existing patient base |
| **Pharmaceutical Companies** (Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly) | Complement medication with nutritional support; patient retention |
| **Major Supplement Companies** (Nestlé Health Science, Church & Dwight) | Enter fast-growing GLP-1 category via acquisition |
| **DTC Wellness Brands** (AG1, Ritual) | Expand product portfolio with GLP-1 specialization |
| **PE / Growth Equity** | Roll-up strategy in fragmented GLP-1 wellness market |

**Exit Multiples (Comparable):**
- DTC supplement brands typically trade at 3-6x revenue
- High-growth subscription brands with strong retention: 5-8x revenue
- At $12M Year 3 revenue (base case): potential valuation of $36-96M
