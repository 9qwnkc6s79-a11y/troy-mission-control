# Noriva — Product Suite
## Complete Product Formulation & Strategy Guide
*Prepared February 2026*

---

## 1. Product Philosophy

### Design Principles

Every Noriva product is formulated around three core principles:

1. **GLP-1 Specificity** — Each ingredient addresses a clinically documented challenge faced by GLP-1 medication users, not generic wellness
2. **Clinical Dosing** — Therapeutic doses backed by peer-reviewed research, not pixie-dust label decoration
3. **Bioavailability First** — Premium ingredient forms that maximize absorption, especially important for patients with altered gastric function

### Why a 4-Product System

GLP-1 patients face four distinct categories of nutritional challenges:

| Challenge | Prevalence | Noriva Product |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Nutrient depletion from reduced food intake | 60%+ of users deficient in key nutrients | Essential Multi |
| Lean mass / muscle loss | 25-40% of weight lost is lean mass | Muscle Guard |
| Gastrointestinal distress | 40-50% experience nausea, bloating | Gut Ease |
| Hair thinning, skin & nail changes | Reported by 5-15% of users; hair loss increasing with GLP-1 RAs | Hair + Glow |

A single product cannot adequately dose all ingredients across four categories. The 4-product system allows therapeutic dosing within each category while keeping daily pill burden manageable.

## 2. Product 1: Essential Multi ($44.99/mo)

### Positioning
"The multivitamin redesigned for reduced caloric intake."

Standard multivitamins assume you're eating 2,000+ calories. GLP-1 patients often consume 1,000-1,400 calories. Essential Multi fills the widened nutrient gaps with enhanced doses of the vitamins and minerals most depleted by GLP-1 therapy.

### Formulation

| Ingredient | Form | Dose (daily) | % DV | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Vitamin D3 | Cholecalciferol | 5,000 IU (125 mcg) | 625% | Deficiency found in 13.6% of GLP-1 users at 12 months (Urbina et al., 2026). Average intake only 20% of RDA. Critical for bone health during rapid weight loss. |
| Vitamin B12 | Methylcobalamin | 1,000 mcg | 41,667% | GLP-1 RAs impair gastric absorption of B12 (delayed gastric emptying). Methylcobalamin is superior bioavailability to cyanocobalamin. 64% risk of deficiency per Noriva site data. |
| Iron (Bisglycinate) | Ferrous bisglycinate | 18 mg | 100% | GLP-1 users show 26-30% lower ferritin levels (Urbina et al., 2026). Bisglycinate form reduces GI distress — critical for patients already experiencing nausea. |
| Folate | L-5-MTHF (Quatrefolic®) | 800 mcg DFE | 200% | Active form bypasses MTHFR mutation (~40% of population). Supports DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation. |
| Zinc | Zinc bisglycinate | 25 mg | 227% | Depleted with reduced food intake. Essential for immune function, wound healing, and hair growth. |
| Magnesium | Magnesium glycinate | 200 mg | 48% | Most common deficiency in US adults. Glycinate form is gentle on GI tract and supports muscle function, sleep, and mood. |
| Calcium | Calcium citrate | 500 mg | 38% | >60% of GLP-1 users below calcium requirements (Urbina et al., 2026). Citrate form doesn't require stomach acid for absorption (important given altered gastric function). |
| Vitamin K2 | MK-7 (MenaQ7®) | 100 mcg | 83% | Synergistic with D3 and calcium for bone health. Directs calcium to bones, not arteries. |
| Vitamin A | Beta-carotene + Retinyl palmitate | 900 mcg RAE | 100% | Fat-soluble vitamin depleted with reduced fat intake. Mixed form ensures safety. |
| Vitamin C | Ascorbic acid + buffered | 250 mg | 278% | Enhances iron absorption by 67% (Hallberg et al., 1989). Supports collagen synthesis and immune function. |
| Vitamin E | d-Alpha tocopherol | 15 mg | 100% | Fat-soluble; depleted with reduced dietary fat. Antioxidant protection. |
| Thiamine (B1) | Thiamine HCl + Benfotiamine | 25 mg | 2,083% | Progressive depletion documented in GLP-1 users (Urbina et al., 2026). Case report of severe neuropathy from thiamine deficiency on semaglutide (Donigan et al., 2025). Benfotiamine has 5x bioavailability. |
| Riboflavin (B2) | Riboflavin-5-phosphate | 10 mg | 769% | Active form. Supports energy metabolism during caloric restriction. |
| Vitamin B6 | P-5-P (Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate) | 25 mg | 1,471% | Active form. Supports protein metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. |
| Selenium | Selenomethionine | 55 mcg | 100% | Thyroid support. Important during metabolic changes from weight loss. |
| Chromium | Chromium picolinate | 200 mcg | 571% | Supports healthy blood sugar metabolism. Synergistic with GLP-1 therapy for glucose control. |
| Copper | Copper bisglycinate | 1 mg | 111% | Balances zinc supplementation. Supports iron metabolism. |
| Iodine | Potassium iodide | 150 mcg | 100% | Thyroid function support during metabolic shift. |

**Format:** Capsules (3 per day) — capsules preferred over tablets for easier swallowing with reduced appetite; also superior absorption.

## 3. Product 2: Muscle Guard ($44.99/mo)

### Positioning
"Defend your lean mass. Fuel your muscles through weight loss."

Clinical trials show 25-40% of GLP-1-induced weight loss comes from lean body mass. Muscle Guard provides the key nutrients shown to preserve muscle during caloric deficit.

### Formulation

| Ingredient | Form | Dose (daily) | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| HMB (β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate) | Calcium HMB (as myHMB®) | 3,000 mg | Gold-standard muscle preservation compound. Meta-analysis shows HMB preserves lean mass during caloric deficit (Wu et al., JISSN 2015). 3g/day is the clinically validated dose. |
| Creatine Monohydrate | Creapure® | 5,000 mg | Most studied supplement for muscle preservation. Maintains strength during caloric restriction. Supports cognitive function. 5g is the standard maintenance dose (Kreider et al., JISSN 2017). |
| Vitamin D3 | Cholecalciferol | 2,000 IU | Vitamin D deficiency associated with muscle weakness and sarcopenia. GLP-1 users commonly deficient. Supports muscle protein synthesis (Chiang et al., Nutrients 2021). |
| L-Leucine | Free-form | 3,000 mg | Primary amino acid trigger for muscle protein synthesis (mTOR pathway). Patients with suppressed appetite need concentrated leucine beyond food sources (Norton & Layman, J Nutrition 2006). |
| Collagen Peptides (Type I & III) | Hydrolyzed bovine | 5,000 mg | Supports connective tissue, tendons, and joints under stress from rapid weight loss. Improves body composition in conjunction with resistance training (Zdzieblik et al., British J Nutrition 2015). |
| Astaxanthin | Natural (from Haematococcus pluvialis) | 12 mg | Reduces exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammation. Supports recovery during caloric deficit (Brown et al., Nutrients 2018). |
| Vitamin K2 | MK-7 | 50 mcg | Supports muscle energy metabolism. Synergistic with vitamin D3 (Shioi et al., Nutrients 2020). |

**Format:** Powder (single-serve stick packs) — unflavored or light vanilla. Mixable with water, smoothies, or protein shakes. Powder format allows therapeutic dosing of HMB, creatine, and leucine without swallowing 10+ pills.

## 4. Product 3: Gut Ease ($44.99/mo)

### Positioning
"Calm your gut. Stay on your medication."

GI distress is the #1 reason patients discontinue GLP-1 therapy. Gut Ease addresses nausea, bloating, constipation, and digestive discomfort so patients can stay the course.

### Formulation

| Ingredient | Form | Dose (daily) | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| Ginger Root Extract | Standardized to 5% gingerols | 500 mg | Gold-standard anti-nausea botanical. Meta-analysis of 12 RCTs confirms efficacy for nausea and vomiting (Lete & Allué, Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci 2016). Safe in pregnancy — proven safe with medication. |
| Probiotics (Multi-strain) | Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium lactis, B. longum | 20 billion CFU | Supports gut microbiome disrupted by altered gastric motility. L. rhamnosus GG is the most studied probiotic strain (Capurso, J Clin Gastroenterol 2019). Shelf-stable strains. |
| Digestive Enzyme Complex | Amylase, protease, lipase, lactase, cellulase | 250 mg | Supports breakdown of food when gastric emptying is slowed. Reduces bloating and gas from partially digested food sitting in stomach. |
| Peppermint Oil (Enteric-Coated) | Standardized to 40% menthol | 180 mg | Reduces bloating and abdominal discomfort. Enteric coating protects stomach and targets intestinal release. IBgard® mechanism (Alammar et al., BMC Complement Med 2019). |
| Psyllium Husk | Organic, finely ground | 2,000 mg | Soluble fiber for constipation management (major GLP-1 side effect). Also supports blood sugar regulation. Gentle and effective (McRorie, Nutr Today 2015). |
| L-Glutamine | Free-form | 2,000 mg | Primary fuel for intestinal epithelial cells. Supports gut lining integrity during altered digestive function (Kim & Kim, Int J Mol Sci 2017). |
| Artichoke Leaf Extract | Standardized to 2.5% cynarin | 300 mg | Supports bile production and fat digestion (impaired with reduced food intake). Clinical evidence for dyspepsia relief (Marakis et al., Phytomedicine 2002). |
| Fennel Seed Extract | 4:1 extract | 200 mg | Traditional carminative — reduces gas and bloating. Supports gastric motility (Portincasa et al., J Gastrointestin Liver Dis 2016). |
| Zinc Carnosine | PepZin GI® | 75 mg | Supports gastric mucosal integrity. Clinically shown to reduce GI discomfort (Mahmood et al., Gut 2007). |

**Format:** Capsules (2 per day, taken before meals) + powder sachets for acute nausea relief. Two formats give patients flexibility — daily maintenance capsules + rescue powder for dose-increase days.

## 5. Product 4: Hair + Glow ($44.99/mo)

### Positioning
"Your weight loss journey shouldn't cost you your hair, skin, or confidence."

Telogen effluvium (stress-induced hair loss) affects a significant percentage of GLP-1 users. Combined with skin changes from rapid weight loss and nutrient depletion, Hair + Glow addresses the beauty-from-within concerns that are a major source of anxiety.

### Formulation

| Ingredient | Form | Dose (daily) | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| Biotin | D-Biotin | 5,000 mcg | Supports keratin production. Deficiency directly causes hair loss. Clinical evidence for hair growth at 2,500-5,000 mcg doses (Patel et al., Skin Appendage Disord 2017). |
| Marine Collagen Peptides | Hydrolyzed Type I (fish-derived) | 5,000 mg | Supports skin elasticity during rapid weight loss. Reduces wrinkles and improves skin hydration (Bolke et al., Nutrients 2019). Marine collagen has superior bioavailability to bovine for skin applications. |
| Iron (Bisglycinate) | Ferrous bisglycinate chelate | 18 mg | Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional cause of hair loss, and GLP-1 users show 26-30% lower ferritin (Urbina et al., 2026). Bisglycinate form minimizes GI side effects. |
| Zinc | Zinc picolinate | 15 mg | Zinc deficiency causes telogen effluvium and impaired wound healing. Picolinate form for maximum absorption. |
| Vitamin C | Ascorbic acid | 500 mg | Essential for collagen synthesis and iron absorption. Antioxidant protection for skin (Pullar et al., Nutrients 2017). |
| Vitamin E | d-Alpha tocopherol + mixed tocopherols | 30 mg | Protects against oxidative damage to hair follicles. Supports skin health (Keen & Hassan, Dermatol Pract Concept 2022). |
| Saw Palmetto Extract | Standardized to 45% fatty acids | 320 mg | Inhibits 5-alpha reductase. Emerging evidence for hair loss in both men and women (Rossi et al., J Altern Complement Med 2012). |
| Horsetail Extract | Standardized to 7% silica | 500 mg | Natural source of silicon, which supports hair strength and growth. Clinical evidence for reduced hair breakage (Araújo et al., Anais Brasileiros de Dermatologia 2016). |
| Hyaluronic Acid | Low molecular weight | 120 mg | Supports skin hydration from within. Addresses "Ozempic face" concern — skin dryness and volume loss (Oe et al., Nutrition J 2017). |
| Vitamin A | Beta-carotene | 750 mcg RAE | Supports skin cell turnover and sebum production. Important for scalp health. |
| MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane) | OptiMSM® | 1,000 mg | Organic sulfur compound supporting keratin and collagen production. Clinical evidence for hair and nail growth (Butawan et al., Nutrients 2017). |
| Astaxanthin | Natural | 4 mg | Powerful antioxidant that protects skin from UV damage and supports elasticity. "Internal sunscreen" effect (Tominaga et al., Acta Biochim Pol 2012). |

**Format:** Capsules (3 per day) + collagen can be offered as additional powder sachet for mixing in beverages.
