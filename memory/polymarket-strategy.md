# Polymarket Trading Strategy — Troy's Playbook

## Philosophy
- Quick-resolution markets (hours to days)
- Information edge > gambling
- Small positions, high frequency
- Track every trade with thesis + outcome
- Scale up only after proven hit rate

## Rules
- **Max single bet:** 40% of bankroll (AGGRESSIVE mode)
- **Target markets:** Resolve within hours to 7 days
- **Edge required:** Any detectable edge — act fast, don't overthink
- **Categories:** Anything where X/Twitter gives early signal
- **Primary intel source:** X (Twitter) — news breaks there first
- **Speed > caution:** First mover advantage is the whole game
- **Bankroll management:** Ride winners, cut losers fast

## Strategy Types

### 1. X-First News Trading (PRIMARY)
Monitor X 24/7 for breaking news that affects open markets. Act BEFORE the market adjusts.
- Journalist tweets → I buy/sell → crowd catches up → profit
- Insider leaks, rumors, anonymous sources
- Political figures posting → immediate market impact
- Speed is everything. Minutes matter.

### 2. Sentiment Momentum
Track X sentiment shifts — when a narrative is building, ride the wave before it peaks.
- Hashtag velocity, quote-tweet storms, viral threads
- Works especially well on political/cultural markets

### 3. Live Event Scalping
During live events (awards, votes, sports), X reacts in real-time.
- Grammy winner leaked backstage → buy before resolution
- Political vote count threads → trade the swings
- Fast in, fast out

### 4. Contrarian Plays
When X consensus is overwhelmingly one direction but the fundamentals say otherwise — bet against the crowd. High risk, high reward.
