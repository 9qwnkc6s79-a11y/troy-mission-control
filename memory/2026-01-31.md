## Menu Strategy Discussion
- Daniel articulated his menu strategy: rotating "secret menu" / featured items that are programmed into Toast with default modifiers so baristas don't need to memorize recipes
- Goal: constantly launch exciting new items without operational challenges
- Advised on Toast online ordering visibility — items can be hidden from online ordering but still appear on KDS when rung up on POS
- Strategy: secret menu = POS only, featured items can temporarily go on online ordering, never delete old items (just hide)
