**Reminder For:** February 7, 2026 (9 AM)

## Task
Try deploying Convex to cloud for persistent remote mission control.

```

## Goal
Make the real-time dashboard work 24/7 regardless of local machine status for true remote operational visibility.

## Current Status
- ✅ Local Convex + ngrok tunnel working
- ❌ Cloud deployment failed due to Convex server issues
- 🎯 Need to retry when their servers are stable

## What This Enables
- Persistent remote monitoring 
- Dashboard works even when laptop is closed
- True mission control independence
