# 2026-02-06 - Boundaries Coffee Dashboard Enhancement Project

## Major Development Project Started
Daniel asked me to take full ownership of enhancing the Boundaries Coffee management dashboard as his web developer. This is a comprehensive project to transform it from basic POS data visualization to a complete business intelligence platform.

## Project Scope & Goals
- **Primary Goal**: Real-time visibility into budget vs actual performance to see if they'll hit projections
- **Key Requirements**: 
  - Fix Toast POS API rate limiting issues
  - Integrate Meta & TikTok marketing data
  - Add QuickBooks Online financial integration
  - Build forecasting and budget tracking
  - Ensure 100% real data (no mock data)

## Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Repository**: https://github.com/9qwnkc6s79-a11y/Boundaries-Management-Dashboard
- **Stack**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Recharts
- **Approach**: Enhanced the existing foundation rather than rebuilding from scratch
- **Data Strategy**: Multi-API integration with caching, retry logic, and graceful fallbacks

## What I Built Today
1. **Enhanced Data Services**:
   - `dataCache.ts` - Smart caching to reduce API calls
   - `retry.ts` - Exponential backoff for API reliability
   - `metaAdsApi.ts` - Facebook/Instagram ads integration
   - `tiktokAdsApi.ts` - TikTok for Business API integration  
   - `quickbooksApi.ts` - QuickBooks Online financial data
   - `enhancedDataService.ts` - Orchestrates all data sources

2. **New Dashboard Components**:
   - `MarketingMetrics.tsx` - Cross-platform advertising performance
   - `FinancialMetrics.tsx` - P&L, budget vs actual, cash flow
   - `ForecastMetrics.tsx` - Revenue projections and confidence tracking
   - `DataQualityStatus.tsx` - API health monitoring and connection management

3. **Enhanced Main App**:
   - Replaced `App.tsx` with tabbed interface
   - Added Overview, Marketing, Financial, Forecast, Operations, and Settings tabs
   - Real-time data quality alerts
   - Auto-refresh with configurable intervals

## Current Status
- ✅ Local development environment running (localhost:3001)
- ✅ Core architecture and services implemented
- ✅ All major components built and integrated
- ⚠️ API integrations need credentials/authentication setup
- ⚠️ Not yet pushed to GitHub (waiting for Daniel's local review)

## Next Steps
- Test all API integrations with real credentials
- Handle authentication flows for Meta, TikTok, QuickBooks
- Optimize mobile responsiveness
- Add export functionality (PDF, Excel)
- Performance testing and optimization

## Daniel's Instructions
- Work locally, don't push to GitHub until he reviews
- Use browser automation for API setup when needed
- If stuck on something, move to another element and come back
- Take liberty to improve where I think it needs it
- Aim for 100% real data, no mock fallbacks
- Help him see in real-time if they'll make budget/projections

## Business Context
- Boundaries Coffee: 2 drive-through locations (Little Elm, Prosper, TX)
- Currently fundraising $1.5M to buy out partners
- Uses Toast POS, QuickBooks Online
- Active on Meta/Instagram and TikTok advertising
- Needs comprehensive business intelligence for decision making

This is a significant project that could transform how Daniel manages his business operations and financial planning.
