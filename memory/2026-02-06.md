# Memory Log - February 6, 2026

## Mission Control Dashboard Overhaul
- **Complete design redesign** to professional minimal aesthetic
- Removed all emojis, flashy colors, marketing-style content
- Dark theme with Inter font, sophisticated typography
- Clean glassmorphism cards, minimal color palette
- Deployed to https://clawd-one-taupe.vercel.app

## Vercel Deployment Issues & Fixes
- **Problem**: Internal links getting 404 errors on deployed site
- **Root cause**: Vercel subdirectory routing issues
- **Solution**: Moved HTML viewers to root directory (search-viewer.html, activity-viewer.html, calendar-viewer.html)
- **Final fix**: Updated vercel.json builds configuration
- **Status**: ✅ All links working on deployed site

## Real-Time Data Discussion
- **Current limitation**: Dashboard shows static snapshot data, not live updates
- **Problem**: Activity logs, search index don't update without manual git pushes
- **Daniel's feedback**: "The point is real time data"
- **Decision**: Started implementing Convex integration for live data
- **Status**: In progress (npm permission issues encountered, will continue)

## Key Decisions
- Professional aesthetic > consumer-friendly design for mission control
- Real-time data is essential for remote monitoring
- Convex + Vercel combination for live operational visibility
- Early compaction preferred to manage context limits

## Notes
- Dashboard design feedback: "Working! Design is good"
- Links finally working after multiple deployment attempts
- Need to complete Convex setup for true mission control functionality
