## Latte Marketing Research
Daniel asked to research existing latte content across Meta, Canva, and Google Drive for Boundaries Coffee.

### Findings:
- **Tiramisu Latte**: 5 professional product images on Canva, NOT on Toast POS
- **Banana Foster Latte**: Has content (branded graphic with logo), IS on Toast POS already
- **Cherry Truffle**: On POS + has Canva designs, quick win for promotion
- **Key Lime Pie Matcha**: Currently boosted on Meta, needs POS verification
- **Google Drive**: No latte marketing content — all drink assets live on Canva
- Instagram login (boundariescoffee) failed with stored password — needs update

### Daniel's AI Content Approach:
- Has a ChatGPT project with a "master plan" for maintaining cup design consistency
- Generated branded content for both Tiramisu Latte and Banana Foster Latte
- Both images have Boundaries Coffee logo, "Texas Proud" branding, and ingredient descriptions
- Same template style — cohesive as a series

## Toast POS — Tiramisu Latte Setup (In Progress)
- Adding Tiramisu Latte to Secret Hot + Cold Lattes at BOTH Prosper and Little Elm
- Recipe: Tiramisu syrup + cocoa powder topping
- First sub-agent attempt partially failed — added "Tiramisu" modifier to Recipe Flavors for hot lattes at Prosper, but it saved as "Ti" in the list (item name shows "Tiramisu" though)
- Toast's Backbone.js framework doesn't respond to JS value setters — must use Playwright type/fill actions
- Second sub-agent spawned with better instructions and 15min timeout

### Little Elm Progress:
- ✅ Verified Tiramisu modifier exists in Recipe Flavors
- ✅ Created "Iced Tiramisu Latte" in Secret Cold Lattes
- ❌ Still needs modifier defaults set (Tiramisu + Cocoa Powder)
- ❌ Still needs Hot Tiramisu Latte created

Daniel decided to finish Toast setup himself since he knows the interface better.

## Meta Ads Analysis & Campaign Overhaul
### Current Problems Discovered:
- 3 identical "messaging conversation" campaigns running simultaneously = $36/day waste
- Zero actual conversions (no messaging started)
- Wrong objectives for a retail coffee business
- No local targeting or store visit tracking

### Actions Taken:
- ✅ **PAUSED all 3 messaging campaigns** → Immediate $252/week savings
- ✅ Identified that messaging campaigns are wrong for coffee shops
- ✅ Set up proper campaign strategy focused on store visits

### New Campaign Strategy (In Execution):
1. **Little Elm Store Visits** - $8/day, 3-mile radius
2. **Prosper Store Visits** - $8/day, 3-mile radius  
3. **Local Coffee Awareness** - $6/day, 5-mile radius both stores
4. **Morning Rush Traffic** - $4/day (6-9am) → TapMango ordering
5. **Lunch Rush Traffic** - $4/day (11am-2pm) → Store visits
6. **Tiramisu Launch Campaign** - $6/day with branded images

**Total budget: $36/day** (same spend, actual results)

### Dashboard Development:
Sub-agent building comprehensive advertising dashboard for Vercel deployment:
- Real-time ROAS tracking (Toast sales vs ad spend)
- Store visit analytics
- Rush hour performance metrics  
- Seasonal campaign ROI tracking
- Meta Business API + Google Ads API integration

## Key Learning: Toast Input Fields
- Toast POS uses a JS framework (likely Backbone.js) that doesn't pick up programmatic value changes
- Must use Playwright's actual type/fill actions, NOT JavaScript nativeInputValueSetter + dispatchEvent
- The framework binds to keyboard events, not change/input events from JS

## Business Strategy Insights
- Daniel's coffee shops need **customers in doors**, not social engagement
- Messaging campaigns completely wrong for retail business model
- Focus should be: store visits, local awareness, rush hour targeting
- Proper metrics: foot traffic, sales correlation, cost per actual customer (not cost per like/comment)
