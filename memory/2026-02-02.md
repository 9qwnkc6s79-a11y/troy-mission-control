## Meta Ads Audit & Fix
- Did a full audit of Boundaries Coffee Meta ads
- Found major issues: store visit campaigns had US-wide targeting instead of local
- Fixed Prosper Store Visits: changed location from "United States" to "Prosper, TX + 3mi" radius
- Daniel fixed Little Elm Store Visits radius himself (was struggling with Meta's UI for that one)
- Published both campaigns - they went from "In draft" to "Processing"
- Killed the last active messaging campaign (was wasting $12/day)
- Only active campaign left besides store visits: "Promoting Boundaries Coffee" at $8/day (Follow or like objective)
- 1 ad set (New Traffic Ad) had an error and wasn't published - needs to be checked later
- Opportunity score jumped from 0 to 97 after publishing

## Campaigns Status After Changes
- **Prosper Store Visits** — $8/day, Awareness, 3mi radius around Prosper — PUBLISHED (Processing)
- **Little Elm Store Visits** — $8/day, Awareness, 3mi radius around Little Elm — PUBLISHED
- **Promoting Boundaries Coffee** — $8/day, Follow or like — ACTIVE (low priority, not ideal objective)
- All messaging campaigns — OFF
- All old boost posts — OFF
- Total active spend: ~$24/day

## Key Learnings
- Meta Ads Manager UI is complex with Advantage+ audience being the default - need to explicitly switch to original audience options for local targeting
- The "Switch to original audience options" flow has a dialog asking about limiting audience
- Location targeting defaults are very broad (US-wide)
