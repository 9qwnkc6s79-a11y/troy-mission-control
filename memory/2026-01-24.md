# 2026-01-24 - First Day Online

## The Bootstrap

Daniel set me up while watching Troy (2004) — hence my name. Professional assistant vibe. He wants a life coach + assistant hybrid who can:
- Handle tedious tasks so he can focus on big stuff
- Provide accountability and structure
- Help with strategic thinking
- Keep things from falling through cracks

## Key Context Gathered

**Business:** Boundaries Coffee, 2 drive-through specialty coffee locations (Little Elm, Prosper TX). Solo entrepreneur, wears all hats. Has manager at one store, hiring for the other.

**Fundraising:** $2.25M deal to buy out partners, due Feb 12. Has $500K raised, CIM is out, needs to follow up with leads and find more. This is urgent — ~3 weeks out.

**Family:** Wife Heather, three kids (4yo daughter, almost-2 daughter, 4mo son). Christian, Reformed Baptist, looking for a church.

**Personality:** Self-aware about being chaotic, "ADD-ish," tends to hyperfocus on passions and neglect other things. Bad at communication. Struggles with follow-through when new exciting things appear. Needs external structure.

**What he likes:** Full Focus planner's "Big 3" concept. Wants order imposed on his chaos.

## Marketing Situation

- Just let go the marketing girl (was expensive)
- Has tons of content but needs someone to write copy and post consistently
- Working with Upfluence for outsourced content creation
- Needs: cup rebrand, spring menu launch, go-to-market plan, consistent posting

## Marketing Calendar Created

Saved to `boundaries-marketing-calendar-2026.md`:
- **Spring Launch:** Thursday, March 12 (teasers start March 2)
- **Summer Launch:** Thursday, May 7
- **Fall Launch:** Thursday, August 20
- **Winter Launch:** Thursday, October 29

**Spring Pre-Launch Timeline:**
- Feb 13: Menu finalized
- Feb 20: Photographer shoot
- Feb 27: Content delivered
- Mar 2: Teasers begin
- Mar 12: LAUNCH

## Winter Menu Notes

From Google Doc - current winter drinks include:
- The Bear (peanut butter, brown sugar, oat milk, teddy graham)
- Creme Brulee Latte/Matcha
- Blueberry Stack
- Gingerbread Capp
- Monthly specials: Pumpkin Pie Latte, Peppermint White Mocha, Cherry Truffle

Daniel didn't like "The Grinch" - it wasn't good.

**Seasonal drink philosophy:** Daniel wants to adopt 7 Brew's model — infinite menu as long as ingredients are in stock. POS (Toast) can show recipes via default modifiers so baristas don't need to memorize everything.

## Weekend Strategy

Daniel wants me doing more automated/background work on weekends so he can focus on family while still making progress. Good use cases:
