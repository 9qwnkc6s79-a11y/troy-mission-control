## Health Data OpenClaw Skill ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE - Daniel's health integration system converted to proper OpenClaw skill

**Discovery:** Daniel already had a fully working health data system in `health-sync/`:
- iOS Shortcuts exports data from Apple Health app
- Python processing with trend analysis and coaching insights
- Daily reports with weight, steps, workouts, and recommendations
- Complete setup documentation and working prototype

**Conversion to OpenClaw Skill:**
- Created `health-data.skill` with conversational query interface
- Added natural language processing for health questions
- Integrated existing working scripts and documentation
- Packaged as proper OpenClaw skill for installation

**Skill Features:**
- **Conversational queries:** "What's my weight today?", "How many steps?", "Any health concerns?"
- **Trend analysis:** 7-day patterns, coaching insights, progress tracking
- **Real-time data:** Synced from iPhone via iOS Shortcuts → iCloud → OpenClaw
- **Comprehensive:** Weight, steps, workouts, calories, heart rate, sleep (if available)

**Files Created:**
- `health-data/SKILL.md` - Complete skill documentation
- `health-data/scripts/query_health.py` - Conversational query interface (11K lines)
- `health-data/scripts/process_health_data.py` - Existing processor (13K lines)
- `health-data/references/` - Setup guide, HealthKit schema, coaching algorithms
- `health-data.skill` - Packaged skill ready for installation

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Current health queries work: "Your current weight is 185.2 lbs"
- ✅ Trend analysis works: Shows weight trends, activity patterns
- ✅ Coaching insights work: "Rapid weight loss (2.6 lbs/week). Consider slowing..."
- ✅ Data integration works: Pulls from existing iOS Shortcuts system

**Technical Implementation:**
- Leverages Daniel's existing iOS Shortcuts → iCloud sync
- No monthly fees or third-party apps required
- Real-time conversational interface for health data
- Integrates with nutrition tracking system
- Extensible for additional health metrics

**Next Steps:**
1. Install skill in OpenClaw if desired
2. Verify iOS Shortcuts are running daily
3. Test conversational health queries in main OpenClaw session

*Daniel had already solved the health data problem - we just made it conversational and packaged it as a proper skill.*
