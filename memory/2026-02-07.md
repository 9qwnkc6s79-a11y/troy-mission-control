# Memory Log - February 7, 2026

## Major System Updates

### OpenClaw 2026.2.6-3 Upgrade
- **Package name change**: clawdbot → openclaw 
- **Successful update** after manual `sudo npm install -g openclaw@latest`
- **Version confirmed**: OpenClaw 2026.2.6-3 (85ed6c7)
- **All systems operational** after gateway restart

### Browser Automation Fixed System-Wide
- **Root problem**: Chrome extension dependency causing frequent failures
- **Solution**: Switched to openclaw-managed browser profile for reliable automation
- **System config updated**: Set `defaultProfile: "openclaw"` 
- **Result**: All agents across all sessions now have reliable browser automation
- **Test successful**: Instagram profile access without manual intervention

### Agent Behavior Improvements
- **Problem**: Daniel identified agents as "too passive and quit very quickly"
- **Solution**: Updated SOUL.md and AGENTS.md to emphasize persistence and decisiveness
- **Key changes**: 
  - "Manual is faster" labeled as cop-out
  - Added "Problem-Solving Approach" section
  - "Your job is to solve problems, not explain why they're hard"
- **Applied system-wide**: All current and future agents will follow new behavior

### Calendar Integration Completed
- **Fixed issue**: Could list calendars but not read events
- **Solution**: AppleScript integration via calendar/calendar-check.sh  
- **Working calendars**: daniel@boundariescoffee.com, daniel.keene223@gmail.com
- **Daily 9 PM summaries**: Fully operational with automated calendar checking

### Communication Expansion Initiative
- **Goal**: Increase agent strength and capability
- **Phase 1 planned**: Voice assistant, email integration, iMessage control
- **Voice interface**: Built voice-assistant.html (ChatGPT-style) but backend incomplete
- **Sub-agent spawned**: Failed immediately (0s runtime) - needs investigation

## Technical Achievements
- **Real-time mission control**: Operational at https://clawd-one-taupe.vercel.app
- **Live activity logging**: Working via Convex + ngrok tunnel
- **Calendar automation**: AppleScript reading events successfully
- **Browser automation**: Independent and reliable across all sessions

## Key Decisions
- Focus on making agents more capable rather than just functional
- Eliminate passive behavior that defaults to manual alternatives
- Prioritize communication tools (voice, email, messaging) for next expansion phase

## Outstanding Issues
- Sub-agent spawn mechanism needs debugging (immediate failure)
- Voice assistant backend integration incomplete
- Email OAuth still needs resolution for full automation
