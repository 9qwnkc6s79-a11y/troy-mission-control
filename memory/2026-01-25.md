# 2026-01-25 - Saturday

## Marketing Work Started
- Set up Later account for Boundaries Coffee (14 days left on trial)
- Connected: Instagram (@boundariescoffee) + Facebook
- Created a draft post: iced coffee image with caption "Good vibes and great coffee ☕✨ What's your go-to order when you need a pick-me-up?" + hashtags
- Note: Image needs cropping for Instagram (too tall)

### Later Content Calendar Status:
**Scheduled (auto-publish ON):**
- Mon 1/26 4:00 AM - Monday motivation post
- Thu 1/29 7:46 PM - "cup of confidence" post

**Drafts (won't publish unless scheduled):**
- Sun 1/25 7:49 PM - iced coffee post I created
- Mon 1/26 7:00 AM - Monday carousel (2 images)

**Gaps:** Tue-Wed have no content scheduled

**Media library:** 347 items - good variety of merch, team photos, latte art, drinks, behind-the-scenes

### Post Ideas Generated:
1. Wed - Team spotlight
2. Fri - Weekend vibes / treat yourself  
3. Sat - Cold brew feature

## Influencer Campaign
- Active campaign: "Sip & Share: Boundaries Coffee Awareness Drive" (via Upfluence)
- New applicant: Sheryna Nicole (6:54 PM notification)
- Pending replies needed:
  - **Devri** - asking about compensation and how to order coffee
  - **mariana (Mahugc_)** - asking about campaign participation details
- Saw in another thread: $200 + $50 gift card mentioned as compensation
- Need to confirm: compensation structure and how influencers receive product (visit or shipped?)

## Communication Preferences Updated
- Daniel asked me to message less
- Updated SOUL.md with explicit guidance: only reach out for significant actions (emails, texts, file changes), when I need help, or something important needs attention
- Do work quietly, report back when done or blocked

## Security Check
- Saw tweet about Clawdbot gateway vulnerability (923 exposed gateways)
- Checked Daniel's config: `bind: "loopback"` ✅ SAFE
- Vulnerability only affects `bind: "all"` configs

## Workflows Established
- Marketing sub-agent spawned for ongoing marketing tasks
- Daniel prefers Option 1: message him directly, spawn sub-agents for complex work
- Sub-agent label: "marketing"

## Sales Plan Completed
Daniel asked for comprehensive sales analysis. Delivered PDF with:
- Root cause: Marketing completely stopped (0 posts last week, $0 ads in 60 days)
- What's working: Weekday sales UP 10-44%, labor controlled, signature drinks sell
- What's wrong: No content, no ads, no new menu excitement
- 6 new drink recipes using existing syrups (no new inventory needed):
  1. Honey Lavender Latte
  2. Strawberry Vanilla Latte
  3. Peach Mango Matcha
  4. Raspberry Mocha (Valentine's)
  5. Orange Honey Cold Brew
  6. Yuzu Citrus Matcha (trending!)
- Monthly "Idea to Menu" workflow established
- Content calendar: 4 posts + 5 stories per week minimum
- Ad budget recommendation: $300/month

## Meta Insights Pulled
- 0 content posted last week
- $0 ad spend last 60 days
- Last campaign (Oct-Nov): 152K views for $450 - worked great
- Interactions down 60.9%
- Net followers: only +2
