# Payroll Audit SOP

## Purpose
Compare scheduled positions in Sling against actual clock-in positions in Toast to identify discrepancies where employees worked (and were paid for) a different position than scheduled.

## Why This Matters
- Team Leaders earn $12/hr vs Team Members at $10/hr
- Employees clocking in as Team Leader when scheduled as Team Member = overpayment
- Catches timesheet fraud or accidental wrong-position clock-ins
- Ensures payroll accuracy

## Frequency
- Weekly (after each pay period closes)
- Run before payroll processing

## Data Sources
1. **Sling** - Scheduled shifts with positions
2. **Toast** - Actual timesheets with clock-in positions
3. **Sling Reports** - Labor/Payroll reports (shows both scheduled and actual, since Toast data syncs to Sling)

## Audit Process

### Step 1: Access Sling Reports
1. Go to https://app.getsling.com/reports
2. Navigate to **Labor** tab
3. Set date range to the pay period being audited
4. Review the comparison of "sch. hours" vs "act. hours" by position

### Step 2: Identify Discrepancies
Look for employees where:
- Actual position hours don't match scheduled position hours
- Employee worked a higher-paying position than scheduled (Team Leader vs Team Member)
- Employee worked shifts they weren't scheduled for at all
- Hours worked significantly exceed scheduled hours

### Step 3: Flag Issues
For each discrepancy, document:
- Employee name
- Date(s) of issue
- Scheduled position & hours
- Actual position & hours
- Pay rate difference
- Dollar impact

### Step 4: Investigate
- Was this an approved shift change?
- Did they cover for someone who called out?
- Was it a manager-approved position upgrade?
- Or was it an error/unauthorized?

### Step 5: Corrective Action
- If unauthorized: Discuss with employee, adjust timesheet to scheduled position
- If approved but not documented: Update schedule retroactively for records
- If recurring issue: Training on proper clock-in procedures

## Key Positions & Pay Rates
| Position | Hourly Rate |
|----------|-------------|
| Team Member | $10.00 |
| Team Leader | $12.00 |
| GM (On Bar) | $14.50 |
| General Manager (Salary) | Salaried |

## Red Flags to Watch For
1. **Position Mismatch**: Scheduled as Team Member, clocked as Team Leader
2. **Unscheduled Hours**: Worked hours with no corresponding schedule
3. **Location Mismatch**: Clocked in at wrong location
4. **Overtime**: Hours exceeding 40/week without approval
