## 🚨 Position Discrepancies Found

### 1. Kaelie Plaskey Plaskey - MAJOR
**Location:** Boundaries Coffee (Prosper)

| Metric | Scheduled | Actual |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Team Member | 15.5h @ $10 | 0h |
| Team Leader | 0h @ $12 | 38.08h |

**Issue:** Scheduled only as Team Member but clocked in as Team Leader for ALL 38 hours worked.

**Financial Impact:**  
- Should have been paid: 15.5h × $10 = $155.00
- Actually paid: 38.08h × $12 = $457.00
- **Overpayment: $302.00** (combination of extra hours + wrong rate)

**Action Needed:** Investigate - was she covering as TL for someone? If unauthorized, adjust future timesheets.

| Metric | Scheduled | Actual |

**Issue:** Worked 14h more as Team Leader than scheduled. Clocked fewer Team Member hours.

**Financial Impact:**  
- Scheduled cost: (18 × $10) + (6.5 × $12) = $258.00
- Actual cost: (9.97 × $10) + (20.53 × $12) = $346.06

**Action Needed:** Verify if TL hours were approved.

**Issue:** Not scheduled for ANY Team Leader shifts but worked 8.82h as TL.

**Financial Impact:**  
- Scheduled cost: 20h × $10 = $200.00
- Actual cost: (10.52 × $10) + (8.82 × $12) = $210.96
- **Overpayment: $10.96** (less hours but higher rate offset)

**Action Needed:** Clarify who approved TL clock-in.

## ⚠️ Other Notable Variances

### Cooper Spann
Multiple locations and positions. Worked across both Prosper and Little Elm.
- Total hours: 30.64h actual vs 31.5h scheduled
- Mix of TL and TM work - appears mostly legitimate cross-coverage

### Brayden Beverley
- Scheduled: 2.5h TL + 7h TM = 9.5h
- Actual: 0h TL + 7.3h TM = 7.3h
- **Underpayment risk** - didn't work scheduled TL hours

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Review Kaelie's timesheets - $302 variance is significant
2. **Process:** Require manager approval before employees can clock in as a different position than scheduled
3. **Training:** Remind team to clock in for their SCHEDULED position, not just any position
4. **System:** Consider enabling position lock in Toast so employees can only clock into scheduled positions
